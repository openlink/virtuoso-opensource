	Without this setting, the build actually does the correct thing for
	all versions of automake 1.9 and newer, so we leave it out for now

	Merge branch 'feature/graph_crud_nquad' into develop/7

2023-05-12  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	Added n-quads support for SPARQL CRUD using REST (fixes #1142)

	  $ curl -i --digest -u dba:dba http://localhost:8890/sparql-graph-crud-auth \
	    -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/n-quads' --data-binary @test.nq

	A default POST request can add triples to the existing graph.

	If you want to clean all the graphs mentioned in your .nq file,
	you can use a PUT command, which will do a 'with-delete' similar
	to the bulk loader. This feature has similar restriction:

	  1. Graphs cannot be split over 2 or more files
	  2. Graphs should be limited in size based on available memory

	Added note on `subdir-objects` setting for automake

	This setting only removes some warning messages generated by
	the automake program, but may become compulsary in automake v2.0.

	Using automake versions v1.9 through v1.15, this setting actually breaks
	the build with badly generated dependency files.

	Without this setting, the build actually does the correct thing for
	all versions of automake 1.9 and newer, so we leave it out for now

	Fixed issue starting TPC-D testsuite

2022-10-17  Patrick van Kleef  <pkleef@openlinksw.com>

	Added support for more flexible buffer configuration

	Traditionally we provide a number of precalculated configurations
	in the virtuoso.ini, based on the amount of free memory in the
	system, e.g.:

	  ;; Uncomment next two lines if there is 8 GB system memory free
	  NumberOfBuffer  = 680000
	  MaxDirtyBuffers = 500000

	The user has to manually remove comments from the appropriate lines
	and not forget to modify the values when moving to a bigger/smaller
	system.

	If the user forgets to modify the virtuoso.ini, the defaults will
	take very little memory, but will result in very poor performance.

	Most users do not know how to calculate the amount of memory used
	by the NumberOfBufffers which uses the following formula:

	  amount memory allocated = NumberOfBuffers * 8192 bytes

	This makes it difficult for users to tune Virtuoso memory consumption.

	To solve this problem, NumberOfBuffers can now be expressed as an
	amount of memory, e.g.:

	  NumberofBuffers = 5000M      ; calculate max NumberOfBuffers that will fit in 5000MB mem
	  NumberOfBuffers = 5G         ; calculate max NumberOfBuffers that will fit in 5GB mem

	When using EC2, Azure, or containers like kubernetes and docker,
	we need a more flexible configuration, which allows for a single
	Virtuoso configuration to scale to the amount of memory installed
	on the machine.

	To scale automatically, NumberOfBuffers can now be expressed as a
	percentage, e.g.:

	  NumberOfBuffers = 50%        ; use 50% of installed memory for buffers

	This will allow OpenLink to create new marketplace instances for
	BYOL, PAYGO and DBpedia instances that will automatically scale
	when the enduser instantiates it on a 16GB, or a 64GB or larger
	system.

	Additionally we now allow MaxDirtyBuffers to be expressed as a
	percentage of the NumberOfBuffers that can be dirty.

	  MaxDirtyBuffers = 75%        ; allow upto 75% of NumberOfBuffers to be dirty

	Added [SPARQL] MaxMemInUse setting to default virtuoso.ini

2022-03-31  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	* Added support to fine tune size of memory pool used by SPARQL constructs

	The operator of a SPARQL endpoint may want to limit the amount of
	memory Virtuoso can use for construct queries, to make sure its
	users cannot use up too many resources.

	Once this limit is reached, the SPARQL query will return the following
	error:

	    Virtuoso 42000 Error D1CT0: Hash dictionary memory pool is full,
	    XXXX exceeded YYYY bytes

	To fine tune the MaxMemInUse setting in the [SPARQL] section, use
	the isql tool to perform the following steps:

	  * Check current setting of MaxMemInUse:

	SQL> select sys_stat('sparql_max_mem_in_use');

	  * Temporarily set the in memory setting to unlimited:

	SQL> __dbf_set('sparql_max_mem_in_use', 0);

	  * Run the construct queries that failed with the above D1CT0 error
	    which should now run to completion

	  * Find out the maximum size the dict mempool reached:

	SQL> select sys_stat('dict_max_mp_bytes_in_use');

	  * Change the INI to persist the setting in the virtuoso.ini file.
	    Use a value that is greater or equal to the value reported by
	    the previous command.

	[SPARQL]
	MaxMemInUse = ZZZZ       ; Use 0 for unlimited

	  * Shutdown and restart the Virtuoso database for this setting
	    to come into effect

2022-03-31  Patrick van Kleef  <pkleef@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed MaxMemInUse setting to allow specifying sizes in G, M, B

2022-03-31  Patrick van Kleef  <pkleef@openlinksw.com>

	Previous change was too disruptive on existing installations.

2022-03-29  Patrick van Kleef  <pkleef@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed name of arg

2022-03-29  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed always check mem for construct dict, never w/o limit

	The [SPARQL] MaxMemInUse now defaults to 200m

	It should only be set to 0 (unlimited) when the operator understands
	the impact on the system.

2022-03-28  Patrick van Kleef  <pkleef@openlinksw.com>

2022-03-04  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed backup_online syntax

	The backup_online function can be used to point to multiple directories,
	preferably on different filesystems, so if one directory is full, the
	backup can continue in the second directory.

	Syntax for using multiple directories is:

	  backup_online ('prefix-', 10000000, 0,
	vector ('/disk1/backup1', '/disk2/backup2'));

	This patch allows a single directory to be specified, without the use of
	a vector with one element e.g.:

	  backup_online ('prefix-', 10000000, 0, '/disk1/backup1');

2022-03-04  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	Updated ChangeLog

	Fixed copyright

2022-02-17  Mitko Iliev  <imitko@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed use a standard namespace URI for special bif: and sql: SPARQL Built-in functions

	The official prefixes are defined as:

	PREFIX bif: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/bif#>
	PREFIX sql: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/sql#>

	which have been added to the default namespace prefix list for new
	databases.

	The code is backward compatible with existing databases, so the old
	magic prefixes also still work:

	PREFIX bif: <bif:>
	PREFIX sql: <sql:>

	This solves a problem for third party parsers that cannot handle <bif:>

	Fixed issue checking geo pred with given geo box.

	When checking geo pred with given geo box, read the geo boxes from
	the rdf obj table.  When one is missing there are less rows of out
	than in.  Index the ser dc, the result from the table with the pos
	of the lc. Will not go out of range.  Get the other geo from the
	set of input to which the set of output corresponds

	Fixed issue with setps (oby, gby) and dfe dependency

	When placing a dfe record all the setps (oby,gby) between the use
	of the value and its computation, the dfe is added as a gby/oby
	dependent. When placing predicates that are imported into a dt and
	these contain subqs e.g. col = scalar subq where the scalar subq
	is independent of the dt being placed, then disable subq caching.
	If kept caching on but placed the subq before the dt the subq would
	be generated twice because renamed once when importing into the dt

	in the freeable ssls.  So do not put duplicate inxes in freeable
	ssls.
