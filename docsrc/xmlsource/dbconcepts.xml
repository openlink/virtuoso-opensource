A key or index is the means by which tables manifest themselves in the
physical database. A key is always defined with respect to one table
but may occur in several as a result of inheritance. Keys have unique
names inside the table. A key has the following characteristics:

			<title>Subtable</title>
			<para>
A subtable is a table that inherits all columns, the primary key and
all other keys from another table, called the super table.
</para>
			<para>
A subtable can define its own columns and keys which add themselves to
those of the super table. No primary key can be redefined, though.
</para>
			<para>
The inheritance relationship between tables is manifested by a key-subkey
relationship between the tables&apos; primary and other keys.
</para>
			<para>
   A table has at most one supertable.
</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="LDMObjectID">
			<title>Object ID</title>
			<para>
A table does not necessarily declare a primary key.  Even so, the table must
have a primary key - in this case a synthetic record ID which is defined
as primary key. The record ID  is an autoincrementing column that is normally
invisible but, if present, can be accessed by explicit reference. One should
not rely on this feature being available, though.
</para>
			<para>
Thus
</para>
			<programlisting>
create table nokey (a integer);
</programlisting>
			<para>
expands to
</para>
			<programlisting>
create table nokey (a integer, _IDN integer identity, primary key (_IDB));
</programlisting>
			<para>
The first unique index to be defined will become the primary key if the table
is empty at the time of definition.
</para>
			<para>
Thus
</para>
			<programlisting>
create unique index a on nokey (a);
</programlisting>

			<programlisting>
create table nokey (a integer, primary key (a));
</programlisting>

Having a primary key other than _IDN is always better than the default primary key.
Declaring a primary key is therefore always advisable.

floating point decimal data type that provides accurate arithmetic and decimal rounding.
The default maximum precision and scale are 40 and 20. The
precision is the number of decimal digits used in the computation. The scale is the maximum number of
decimal digits to the right of the decimal point. Internal calculations
are always precise but
numbers are truncated to the column&apos;s precision and scale when stored.  If a value being stored
has more digits to the left of the decimal point than allowed in the

These types implement a binary large object (BLOB) type. The length can be
up to 2**31 bytes (2GB).
If manipulated with the <function>SQLGetData()</function> and <function>SQLPutData()</function> ODBC functions a BLOB need not fit in the DBMS&apos;s or the client&apos;s memory.
The LONG VARCHAR and LONG VARBINARY types are distinct only because certain ODBC applications
gain from being able to distinguish long text from long binary. The types are described as SQL_LONGVARCHAR and SQL_LONGVARBINARY respectively, with a precision of 2GB.
</para>
			<para>
Several long columns may exist on a single row. A long column may not
be a key part in an index or primary key.
</para>
			<para>
Data in long columns is stored as a linked list of database pages.  Thus, a long column
that does not fit in-line on the containing row will require an integer number of 8K
database pages.  If a long column&apos;s value is short enough to fit within the row
containing it, the BLOB will be stored on the row and will not take more space than a VARCHAR of the
same length.  A long column fits on a row if the sum of the lengths of columns, including the long column, is
under 4070 bytes.
</para>
<para>ORDER BY, GROUP BY and DISTINCT may not reference long data types.  
Comparison of long data is not allowed unless first converted to the 
corresponding short type (varchar, nvarchar or varbinary).  This conversion 
is only possible if the value is under 10MB in size.  String functions accept 
long varchars and long nvarchars and convert them to varchar and nvarchar 
automatically.  There is no long literal type per se, the corresponding character 
or binary type is assignable to a long type.</para>

All the time- and date-related types are internally represented as a
single 'datetime' type consisting of a Julian day, hour, minute, second, 6-digit fraction and timezone.
The range of the year is from 0 to over 9999. This type can accommodate all values of any SQL92 time-related type.
</para>
			<para>
Although the internal representation is the same, a column of a time-related type is described
as being of the appropriate ODBC type, i.e. SQL_TIMESTAMP for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME and SQL_DATE for DATE and SQL_TIME for TIME.
</para>
			<para>
A DATETIME is described as precision 19, a DATE as precision 10 and a TIME as precision 8.
</para>
			<para>
A column declared a TIMESTAMP is automatically set to the timestamp of the transaction that inserts or
updates any column of the table containing it. The timestamp of a transaction is guaranteed to be distinct from that of
any other transaction.  For compatibility reasons a TIMESTAMP column is described to ODBC clients as a binary
of 10 bytes. It is possible to use any date-related functions on TIMESTAMPs and to bind
a TIMESTAMP column to a DATE or DATETIME variable (SQL_C_TIMESTAMP type in ODBC).  Binding to a binary will also work but
the data will then be opaque.
</para>
			<para>
SQL92 provides for types with a timezone. Although the ODBC API does not expose the timezone, it is stored with
these types and can be retrieved with the <function>timezone()</function> function. The timezone has a precision of minutes from UTC.
</para>
			<para>
The storage requirement for these types is 10 bytes.
</para>
<para>There is no date literal per se, but the ODBC shorthand for datetime 
literals can be used.  The datetime/timestamp literal is of the form 
{dt 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.SS'}.  The date literal is of the form 
{d 'YYYY-MM-DD'}.  Dates and datetimes may be compared between themselves but 
not with other types without explicit casting.</para>

		<title>Unicode Support</title>
		<para>
Virtuoso allows 30-bit Unicode data to be stored and retrieved from database fields.
The data are stored internally as UTF-8 encoded strings for storage space optimization.
Unicode fields are easily intermixable with other character data as all SQL functions
support wide-string case and convert to the most wide character representation on demand.
The native width of the wide character type may differ between platforms.  Windows has a 16 bit
wide character, whereas some Unixes have a 32 bit wide character type. The native width applies 
to the Virtuoso NVARCHAR data type when used as SQL data. </para>
			<para>
There are 3 additional data types to enable storing of Unicode data:
</para>
			<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
				<listitem>
					<para>NCHAR</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>NVARCHAR</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>LONG NVARCHAR</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>
All the Unicode types are equivalent to their corresponding
&quot;narrow&quot; type - CHAR,
VARCHAR and LONG VARCHAR - except that instead of storing data as one byte they allow
Unicode characters. Their lengths are defined and returned in characters instead of bytes.
They collate according to the active wide character collation, if any.  By 
default this is the order of the Unicode serialization values.  These types 
can be used anywhere the narrow character types can be used, except in LIKE 
conditions.</para>
  <para>Unicode literals are introduced by n&apos; and closed with &apos; 
  (single quote).  See Internationalization section on the interpretation of 
  wide literals.  This may be either UTF-8 according to some character set.</para>
			<para>
When there is a need to convert a wide string to a narrow one or vice versa,  a character set is
used.  A character set returns a wide string code for a wide char. For
example there can be a definition of the
ISO-8859-5 &quot;narrow&quot; character set which describes mapping of non-ASCII character codes
to their Unicode equivalents.  Virtuoso relies on the fact that the ASCII character codes are represented
in Unicode by type-casting and in UTF8 as one-byte tokens with the same value as in ASCII.
</para>
			<para>
When conversion is done on the server-side using cast or some of the SQL
built-in functions, the wide
characters are converted to narrow using a system-independent server-side character set. In the
absence of such a character set, Virtuoso uses the Latin1 character set to
project narrow character codes into the Unicode space
as equally valued wide-character codes.
</para>
			<para>
When conversion is done client-side - for example, when binding a VARCHAR to a
wide buffer - the default client&apos;s system character set is used.
</para>
			<para>
Wide-character literals have ANSI SQL92 syntax: N&apos;xxx&apos; (prefixing normal literals
with the letter N).  These strings process escapes with a values large enough to represent all the
Unicode characters.
</para>

The built-in data types denoting sequences of characters, wide or narrow,
long or short, are:
</para>
			<simplelist>
			<member>
<emphasis>Varchar</emphasis>: a string of 8-bit characters, including 0's,
up to 16MB long.  These are contiguously stored, so long contents, such as
in the megabytes, will be inefficient.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>NVARCHAR</emphasis>: A string of wide characters, of 2 or 4 bytes each, depending on the
platform.  Because of the 16MB limit, the longest strings will be of 4M or
8M characters, depending on the platform.  Again long strings are not recommended
due to inefficiencies.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>Binary</emphasis>: A string of 8-bit bytes, up to 16 MB long, like a varchar but not
usable for character functions.  There is a distinct binary type only for
compatibility with the SQL92 standard and ODBC, where the binary type is
treated differently in parameter binding.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>Long varchar, long nvarchar</emphasis>: These are long data types, stored persistently
as a series of linked pages and accessible to clients in fragments using the
<function>SQLGetData()</function> and <function>SQLPutData()</function> calls. The length limit is 2GB.  The wide variant, LONG NVARCHAR, is internally stored as UTF8.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>String_output</emphasis>: This is not a database column type but
a run-time object that
can be used in stored procedures for accumulating a long sequence of 8-bit bytes,
including 0's.  This type is not contiguously stored, hence it stays efficient for
large output and has no built-in size limit; however, it is not automatically
paged to disk, so it will consume virtual memory for all its length.  This type is
useful for buffering output for a next processing step.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>Long varbinary</emphasis>: This is a binary BLOB, identical to long varchar but distinct for
reasons of compatibility with SQL92 and ODBC, where this can behave differently
from long varchar for parameter binding.
</member>
			<member>
<emphasis>XML Entity</emphasis>: This type is a pointer to an element of an XML tree.  The XML
tree itself may be either memory- or disk-based. In both cases there is a
reference-counted set of XML entities for each tree that Virtuoso uses to reference individual
elements of the tree.  These are used for navigating an XML tree in XPath
or XSLT;
hence, one entity gives access to it parents, siblings, and so on.  This is not properly a
string type, but it can be converted to one, producing the XML string value.

All these types have the common trait of representing sequences of characters and
hence some common operations and conversions are possible between them.

as persistent XML (disk-based) if the entity references a persistent XML tree.
Note that this may either extract a subtree or copy a tree, depending on whether
the entity references the root.  If the entity references a memory-based tree,
the text of the tree with the element as the topmost (document) element is
produced and set as the value of the column.</member>

A BLOB column (long varchar, long nvarchar, long varbinary) may return
either a long varchar or a long nvarchar BLOB handle.  If the actual value
is short enough to be inlined, a varchar or nvarchar value can be returned as
the column value instead. These are indistinguishable for assignment and as
arguments to SQL functions or for returning to a client application.  Only
specific SQL functions (<function>isblob()</function>,
<function>isstring()</function>, etc.) allow you to determine the
difference at run time. One exception is persistent XML entities, which
come back as persistent XML entities and are not compatible with string
functions but are assignable to various character columns.

   <sect2 id="colstore"><title>Virtuoso Column Store</title>
     <para>Note: This feature only applies to Virtuoso 7.0 and later.</para>
     <para>As of version 7, Virtuoso offers a column-wise compressed storage format alongside 
     	its traditional row-wise storage format.</para> 
     <para>In the column-wise storage model, each column of a table or index is stored contiguously, so 
     	that values of a single column on consecutive rows are physically adjacent. In this way, adjacent 
     	values are of the same type, and if the index is sorted on said value, the consecutive values 
     	often form an ascending sequence. This organization allows the use of more powerful compression 
     	techniques than could be used for rows where consecutive values belong to different columns, and 
     	thus are of disparate data types with values in different ranges.</para>
     <para>Furthermore, when queries only access a subset of columns from one table, only those 
     	columns actually being accessed need to be read from disk, thereby making better use of I/O 
     	throughput and memory. Unreferenced columns will not take space in the memory based cache 
     	of the database. Further, the traffic between CPU cache and main memory is reduced when 
     	data is more compact, leading to better CPU utilization.</para>
     <para>The column-wise format is substantially more compact and offers substantially greater 
     	sequential-access performance, as well as greater random-access performance in situations 
     	where many rows are accessed together in a join. For single-row random-access, a row-wise 
     	format offers higher performance as long as the data is in memory. In practice, for large 
     	tables, the higher compression achieved with column-wise storage allows a larger portion 
     	of the data to be kept in memory, leading to less frequent I/O and consequently higher 
     	performance.</para>
     <para>One should not use column-wise storage in cases where columns are frequently updated, 
     	especially if a single row is updated per statement. This will give performance substantially 
     	worse than row-wise storage. However, bulk inserts and deletes are efficient with 
     	column-wise storage.</para>
     
     <sect3 id="colstorecreatetblind"><title>Creating Column Store Tables and Indices</title>
       <para>Any index or primary key, i.e., any table, can be declared to be stored column-wise. 
       	A single table can have multiple indices, of which some are stored column-wise and some are 
       	not. As with tables stored row-wise, the table row itself is stored following the primary 
       	key index entry on the index tree leaf corresponding to the entry. This arrangement is 
       	sometimes called a <emphasis>clustered index</emphasis>.</para>
       <para>The statement below declares the table xx to be stored column-wise:</para>
 <programlisting><![CDATA[

                  data  VARCHAR, 
                  PRIMARY KEY (id) COLUMN
                );
 ]]></programlisting>
       <para>This statement adds a column-wise stored index to the table:</para>
 <programlisting><![CDATA[
CREATE COLUMN INDEX xxi 
  ON xx (data);
 ]]></programlisting>
       <para>The <emphasis>COLUMN</emphasis> keyword can come after the column list of the 
       primary key declaration of a table or anywhere between the <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis> 
       and <emphasis>INDEX</emphasis> keywords of a create index statement.</para>
       <para>Note that the <emphasis>BITMAP</emphasis> keyword cannot be used together 
       with the <emphasis>COLUMN</emphasis> keyword. Column-wise indices will automatically 
       use bitmap compression when appropriate without this being specified. A column-wise 
       index is likely to be more space-efficient than a row-wise bitmap index with the same 
       key parts.</para>
       <para>The directives for column compression in <emphasis>CREATE TABLE (NO COMPRESS, COMPRESS PREFIX)</emphasis> 
       have no effect on column-wise stored tables. Data is compressed in a manner chosen at run

     <sect3 id="colstoretransup"><title>Column Store Transaction Support</title>

       	The locking behavior is also identical, with row-level locking supported on all isolation 
       	levels. The behavior of the <emphasis>READ COMMITTED</emphasis> isolation is non-locking,

every modified row. This is useful for single user situations where one does large batch updates on tables.
For example, an update of every row of a multi gigabyte table would be likely to run out of rollback space
before completing. In practice, one can end up in a thrashing situation where a large transaction is in
progress, is interrupted by a checkpoint which must temporarily roll back the changed pages, then again
resume the transaction etc., leading to serious server unavailability. Note that normally the ini parameter
TransactionAfterImageLimit places a cap on transaction size, catching situations of this type before they
lead to thrashing.
                                </para>
                                <para>The row by row autocommit mode prevents this from happening by
committing each updated, inserted or deleted row as soon as all the indices of the row are updated.
This mode will still maintain basic row integrity, i.e. if the row's data is in one index, it will be
in all indices.
                                </para>
                                <para>This mode is good for any batch operations where concurrent
updates are not expected or are not an issue. Examples include bulk loading of data, materialization of
RDF inferred data etc.
                                </para>
                                <para>This mode is enabled with the log_enable function. If the bit
of 2's is set in the argument, row-by-row autocommit is enabled and the setting will persist until
modified with log_enable or the calling connection is disconnected or the calling web request
terminates. Thus, an argument of 2 enables row-by-row autocommit and disables logging. An argument
of 3 enables row-by-row autocommit and enables logging. This will cause every updated row to be
logged in the transaction log after it is updated, which is not very efficient.
                                </para>
                                <para>Since transaction-by-transaction recovery is generally not an
issue in batch updates, a value of 2 is usually better. If the server is killed during the batch
operation, it may simply be restarted and the operation redone. Losing the first half through no
logging will not be an issue since the operation will anyway have to be redone.
                                </para>
                                <para>There is a slight penalty to row-by-row autocommit in comparison with
making updates in larger batches but this is under 10%.

			</sect4>
			<sect4 id="RepeatableRead">
				<title>Repeatable Read</title>
				<para>The transaction will wait for access to exclusively locked rows
and will lock all rows it reads.  The locking of read rows can be shared or exclusive depending
on the FOR UPDATE clause in the SELECT or the SQL_CONCURRENCY statement option.  In the case
of a select over a range of rows where not all rows match selecting criteria,
only matching rows are locked.  This mode guarantees that any row locked by the
reading transaction can be re-read on the basis of its identity (primary key) and will not have
been changed by any other transaction while the locking transaction is in progress.
This mode does not prevent another transaction from inserting new rows
(phantoms) between rows locked by the original transaction.
</para>
			</sect4>
			<sect4 id="Serializable">
				<title>Serializable</title>
				<para>This mode guarantees that concurrent transactions will look as if
the next transaction started only after the previous terminated. This is like <parameter>repeatable read</parameter>
but prevents phantoms.  Space found to be empty
in one read will remain empty in the next read while the transaction is ongoing.
</para>
				<para>Serializable isolation is implemented by locking all ranges of rows matching
criteria pertaining to the ordering index in a select. The range here includes the last row
before the first in the range.  An empty range can be locked by locking the row before the range
by a special follow lock, which prevents insertions to the right of the locked row.  A by-product
of this is that serializable locking guarantees that a select count will give the same result repeatedly unless the transaction itself affect the rows counted.

		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="LockExtent">
			<title>Lock Extent</title>
			<para>
If a transaction is the exclusive owner of locks on a database page and a sufficient percentage
of the rows are locked, it makes sense to replace distinct row locks
with a single page lock.  The LOCK_ESCALATION_PCT parameter controls the threshold for doing
this. See the SET statement for details.
</para>
			<para>
If a cursor reads data serially and has a history of locking a high percentage of rows on
each page it traverses, it will start setting page level locks as its first choice.
It will do this when entering a new page where there are no row-level locks.
</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="TransactionSize">
			<title>Transaction Size</title>
			<para>
There is no limit in Virtuoso to the transaction size, though the
underlying software or hardware may impose limits.  Memory consumed by a transaction
is proportional to its number of locks held and number of changed rows (insert, update, delete).
BKLOBs manipulated by a transaction do not contribute to memory
consumption, because they are always disk-based.

  <sect2 id="UserGroupPriv">
		<title>Users &amp; Group Privileges</title>
		<para>
Virtuoso's support for users, user groups and their security
is similar to that found in most SQL databases.
</para>
		<para>
When a database is created it contains one user account named 'dba'.  The
initial password is 'dba'. When subsequent users are created, the user
name is the default password and users always initially belong to their
own group as its only member. These users only have the privileges granted
to PUBLIC.  The dba user and users moved to the dba group have unlimited
privileges.
</para>
		<sect3 id="UserSchemaObj">
			<title>Users and Schema Objects</title>
			<para>
Any user can create schema objects such as tables, views, and procedures. A non-dba
user is only permitted to create objects whose owner is the user; thus, the owner part of the
qualified object name defaults to the login name of the creating user.  A dba user can also create objects with other owners.
</para>
			<para>
A user irrevocably has all privileges to objects it owns.
This includes further granting these privileges.
</para>
			<para>
A stored procedure or view has the privileges of its owner.
It is therefore possible to grant access to a view or procedure without granting access to the
schema objects referenced by it.
</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="UsersGroups">
			<title>Users and Groups</title>
			<para>
A user is characterized by a unique user name, a unique user id, and a
group id. 

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the user name and
user id. A user account can be used as a user group.   User group ids are
normal user ids. A user has all the privileges granted to it, all the
privileges granted to the user whose user id appears as its group id and
all the privileges granted to PUBLIC. Additionally if the user is dba
- which Virtuoso sets as id 0 - or if its group id is 0, then
it has all privileges.
</para>
			<para>
To use a group, you create a user account for the group and then create
the group members.  After that, the members can be added to the group. For
example, to create a group &apos;staff&apos; with users 'jim' and 'john,'
you would execute the following statements with dba privilege:
</para>
			<screen id="createuser">
create user staff;
create user jim;
create user john;
set user group jim staff;
set user group john staff;
</screen>
			<para>
Now the dba can grant privileges to staff and those will apply to users
logged in as either jim or john. Note that since staff is a user account
one can also log in as staff. To grant select on STOCK to staff, one can execute:
</para>
			<screen id="grant">
grant select on STOCK to staff;
</screen>
			<para>
The passwords of the accounts default to the user names. It is advisable
to set the password to something else immediately after creating the
accounts.  Users of the dba group can set or change the password of any
user using the following function:
</para>

&user_set_password;

			<para>
Users can change their own passwords when logged in. The SET PASSWORD
statement changes the password associated with the user who executes it.

			<title>User Roles</title>
		<para>

Virtuoso supports a SQL 2K compatible role based security model. 
A role is a grantee in the same namespace as
users but is itself not a user account.  Thus one cannot login as a
role.  A role is a grantable object.  Any role or user may be granted
an arbitrary number of roles.  The effective privileges of a role or
of a user having roles are the union of the effective privileges of
all directly or indirectly granted roles plus grants to public plus
direct grants to the grantee in question.  Role grants may not form cycles.
</para>
<para>
This is not the same as multiple user groups, since indirect memberships are not considered in the multiple groups case. The multiple user groups feature is  deprecated.  
See the CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE statements.
</para>
<para>
There is no dba role.  The GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES statement is the official way of adding a user account to the dba group.
</para>
</sect3>
		<sect3 id="multipleusergroups">
			<title>Multiple User Groups</title>

Virtuoso implements UNIX-style group memberships: a user belongs to a
'primary' group and a set of 'secondary' groups.

		<sect3 id="RevokingPrivs">
			<title>Revoking Privileges</title>
			<para>
Only a privilege that has been granted can be revoked.	More precisely,
the privilege and grantee in a REVOKE statement must be the same as in
a previous GRANT statement. For example:
</para>
			<screen>
grant select  (S_I_ID, S_LEVEL), update (S_LEVEL) to staff;
</screen>
			<para>and </para>
			<screen>
revoke update on STOCK from jim;
</screen>
			<para>
are incompatible, first because &apos;update on STOCK&apos; was never granted and
because nothing was ever granted to jim.  Instead, you should use:
</para>
			<screen>
revoke update (S_LEVEL) on STOCK from staff;
</screen>
			<para>
To revoke a user&apos;s privileges, you should first set the user&apos;s group
to the user itself. This will cause the user to have only the privileges
specifically granted to it or to PUBLIC. Then you can revoke the privileges
of the user one by one.

CREATE USER makes a new user account. The password defaults to the user name.
DELETE USER deletes a user account. The account being dropped may not
have privileges granted to it nor can it be the user group of any user except itself.
Note that user names and passwords are identifiers. This means that they can
be converted to upper case unless quoted if the global CaseMode setting is 1.
</para>
			<para>
SET USER GROUP assigns a group to a user.  By default a user belongs to
its own group. Changing a user&apos;s group to be another user causes the
member user&apos;s effective privileges to be those of the group plus
those granted specifically to the member user.  Privileges are only
inherited from the immediate group, not from the group&apos;s group etc.
</para>
			<para>
The following example illustrates how to use these statements:

</programlisting>
			</example>

After you execute these statements, 'AcctMgr' will have select privileges
on 'Employee' as a result of belonging to the 'Accounting' group

		<para>
The row string is the internal representation of a row of a database. It can be retrieved and passed
in an argument as a single value.   When selecting from a table with subtables, the row string
allows you to determine which table each row actually came from and which column values
are not defined in the supertable given in the select.
</para>
		<para>
A row identity string is the part of a row string that contains the table information and the
primary key. Each row in a database has a unique row identity string. The row identity string
is a regular varchar object that can appear as a column value.  This is a generalization of a
foreign key - a single column reference to an entity whose type is determined at run time.
</para>
		<para>
The object ID is a special data type that resembles a string in that it contains a variable
number of binary bytes.  However, strings and object IDs are distinct and a string is never
equal to an object ID, even if the characters are the same.  An object ID can appear as a
column value, in which case it is a foreign key to another table or a key part of a special
OBJECT_ID index.  The object ID is similar to a row identity string in concept but more restricted
in that it can only reference tables that have a primary key or other index with the OBJECT_ID option on.
The object ID is slightly shorter than a row identity string.
</para>

<title>Internationalization &amp; Unicode</title>

<para>
National strings are best represented as Unicode (NCHAR/LONG NVARCHAR) columns.
There is no guarantee that values stored inside narrow (VARCHAR/LONG VARCHAR)
columns will get correctly represented.  If the client application is also
Unicode then no internationalization conversions take place.
Unfortunately, most current applications still use narrow characters.
</para>
<para>
The national character set defines how strings will get converted from narrow to wide
characters and back throughout Virtuoso.
A character set is an array of 255 (without the zero) Unicode codes
describing the location of each character from the narrow character set in the Unicode
space.  It has a &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;preferred&quot; name and a list of aliases.

<title>Character Set Use in the HTTP Server</title>

The HTTP server appends a <screen>charset=xxxx</screen> attribute to the
<screen>Content-Type:</screen> HTTP header field  when
returning the HTTP header to the client.  This can be overridden by calling
functions such as <function>http_header()</function>.

The HTTP server uses the character set mainly to format correctly
values using the <function>http_value()</function> function or its VSP
equivalent &lt;?= ...&gt;.
In these cases wide values and XML entities - the result of XML
processing function like <function>xpath_contains()</function> - get
represented using the HTTP/XML translation rules described above.
The same rules apply for results returned by the FOR XML directive, by XML
Views, and for WebDAV content.

		<title>Creating A Collation</title>
			<para>
Virtuoso supports collation orders for CHAR and VARCHAR fields that are
different from the binary, as per ANSI SQL92.  When comparing strings
using a collation, Virtuoso compares the &quot;weights&quot; of the
characters instead of their codes.  This allows programs to make different
characters compare as equal (example: case-insensitive comparisons).
</para>
		<para>
A collation can be created by supplying a collation definition text file to
the <function>collation_define()</function> SQL function.  The collation definition file contains a list of
the exceptions to the binary collation order.  An exception consists of &lt;character
code&gt; = &lt;collation weight&gt; pairs.  For example a case-insensitive collation can be defined by specifying
all the lower case letters to have the same collation weights as the corresponding uppercase ones.

			<title>Collations and Column Data</title>
			<para>
The collation is a property of the column holding the data. This means that all comparisons including
that column will use its collation. SQL functions will strip collation data from the
column; for example, if a column &quot;CompanyName&quot; has an assigned collation &quot;Spanish&quot;
then the SQL call <programlisting>LEFT (CompanyName, 10);</programlisting> will use the default collation).
</para>
			<para>
Collations can be defined on a per-column basis, at table creation time,
and on a per-database basis as a configuration parameter.
There is a special form of the CAST operator that allows casting a column
to a collation.
</para>
			<para>
A collation identifier has the same form as any other SQL identifier
(&lt;qualifier&gt;.&lt;owner&gt;.&lt;name&gt;) and it can be
escaped with the same syntax as other identifiers.
