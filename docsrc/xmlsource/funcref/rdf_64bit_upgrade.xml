    <para>There are two data types. IRI_ID is 4-byte and IRI_ID_8 is 8-byte. Initially, IRI_ID columns are created. DB.DBA.RDF_64BIT_UPGRADE() alters them to get IRI_ID_8.</para>
    <para>Note that this is to hold more that 4G of distinct IRIs, number of distinct quads is not limited by 4G even without the upgrade.</para>
    <para>The function should be called once.</para>
    <para>It shutdowns the server at completion upgrade so it should not be called from web-application.</para>
