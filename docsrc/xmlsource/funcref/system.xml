	<para>
The system function will run a shell command from SQL. The shell command is executed
in the server's current directory as the user that owns the database server process.
</para>
			<para>
This function is available to dba users only. Since this is a security
risk this feature is normally disabled. It can be enabled by setting the
AllowOSCalls setting in virtuoso.ini to 1.
