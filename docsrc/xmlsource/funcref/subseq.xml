<para>subseq returns a copy of subsequence of string or vector str using zero-based
    indices from (inclusive) and to (exclusive) to delimit the substring or the vector
    extracted.
</para>
<para>
    If to is omitted or is NULL, then it equals by default to the length of
    str, i.e. everything from from to the end of str is returned.
</para>
<para>
    If to and from are equal, an empty string ''(empty vector) is returned.
</para>
<para>
    If from is greater than to or length of str an error is signalled.
</para>
<para>
    If str is NULL then NULL is returned.
</para>

			<para>
The last one with string argument returns a copy of the string cut from the first slash,
leaving it and everything following out, and in the case where there
are no slashes present, returns a copy of the whole string.
