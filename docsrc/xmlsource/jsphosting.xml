<sect1 id="rthjsp"><title>Deploying JSP Applications</title>

<para>The Virtuoso server with Java hosting support can be used to execute 
JSP pages, however, Virtuoso requires a JSP container engine first.  Jakarta 
provide such an engine that can be hosted inside Virtuoso with Java support.  
This section describes how JSP's can be executed using Jakarta Tomcat JSP 
implementation.</para>

<sect2 id="rthjspprelim"><title>Environment Setup &amp; Verification</title>

<para>The following components are required:</para>

<simplelist>
 <member>Java SDK (or runtime only) needs to be installed.  Version 1.2 or later.</member>
 <member>Jakarta Tomcat package must be installed and configured.  This can 
 be obtained from the <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta project site</ulink> 
 (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/)</member>
</simplelist>

<para>The virtuoso.ini file must edited to including the following settings in the 
<computeroutput>[Parameters]</computeroutput> section:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[.....
JavaClasspath = <jdk install dir>/lib/tools.jar:<tomcat install dir>/bin/bootstrap.jar 
JavaVMOption1 = -Djava.endorsed.dirs=<tomcat install dir>/bin:<tomcat install dir>/common/endorsed
JavaVMOption2 = -Dcatalina.base=<tomcat install dir>
JavaVMOption3 = -Dcatalina.home=<tomcat install dir>
JavaVMOption4 = -Djava.io.tmpdir=<tomcat install dir>/temp
.....]]></programlisting>

<note><title>Note:</title>
<para>The above has been tested for the jakarta-tomcat-4.1.18 distribution 
only.  Setting may vary for any other versions of Jakarta Tomcat, in which case we 
advise you consult the Tomcat documentation.</para></note>

<para>Run the <computeroutput>virtuoso-*-javavm*-t</computeroutput> binary, 
The Virtuoso server that includes Java hosting.</para>

<para>Start the Jakarta Tomcat server inside virtuoso server process using the 
following command from ISQL:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
SQL> java_call_method ('org.apache.catalina.startup.BootstrapService', null, 'main', 'V',
     vector ('[Ljava/lang/String;', vector ('start')));
]]></programlisting>

<para>
In order to invoke the above command automatically at server startup you might 
put it in the autoexec.isql init script.
</para>

<para>Make a virtual directory for accessing JSP server, here is an example:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[vhost_define (lpath=>'/tomcat',ppath=>'http://example.com:8080/');]]></programlisting>

<para>Verify that your installations are correct by pointing your web browser 
of choice to <computeroutput>http://example.com:8890/tomcat/</computeroutput>
(assuming you are working on your local machine).  Run some of JSP examples 
provided with Tomcat distribution to verify that they are executed without errors.</para>
  
<note><title>Note:</title>
<para>For debugging purposes you may run the virtuoso-*-javavm*-t server with
foreground option to receive Java error messages, if any occur.</para></note>
