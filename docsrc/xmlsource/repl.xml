<para>This chapter describes how to replicate data between Virtuoso and non-Virtuoso servers.</para>
<para>
The material in this chapter covers the programmatic means of performing
these  operations.  You can also use the graphical interface to do
replication and synchronization.  This is covered in the <link

<title>Introduction</title>
<para>Virtuoso provides several replication methods:</para>
<sect2 id="PREFACE_SNAPSHOT">
  <title>Snapshot replication</title>
  Virtuoso provides the following flavors of snapshot replication:
  <simplelist>
  <member>
    <para>Non-incremental snapshot replication</para>
    <para>Non-incremental snapshot replication is useful when the data
    is changed infrequently or when data is modified in large portions
    at a time.
    </para>
  </member>
  <member>
    <para>Incremental snapshot replication</para>
    <para>Incremental snapshot replication is useful when
    the data is changed frequently and implements incremental
    updates using a snapshot log.</para>
  </member>
  <member>
    <para>Bi-directional snapshot replication</para>
    <para>Bi-directional snapshot replication allows data to be modified
    on both publisher and subscribers. This  is useful 
     read-write access to the replicas is needed.</para>
  </member>
  </simplelist>
  <note><title>Note:</title>
  <para>Snapshot replication can be used in heterogeneous environments
  to set up replication between non-Virtuoso databases.</para>
  </note>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="PREFACE_TRX">
  <title>Transactional replication</title>
  <para>Transactional replication allows subscribers to receive data
  in near-real time. ACID properties of transactions are maintained
  in transactional replication as well. Virtuoso implements the following
  flavors of transactional replication:
  <simplelist>
  <member>
    <para>Ordinary transactional replication</para>
    <para>Ordinary transactional replication flavor implements one-way data
    replication and is useful when data can be modified on only one server
    with other servers participating in replication providing read-only
    data access.</para>
  </member>
  <member>
    <para>Bi-directional transactional replication</para>
    <para>Bi-directional transactional replication is useful when there is
    a requirement to allow data updates on multiple servers.</para>

		<title>Snapshot Replication</title>
		<sect2 id="NONINC">
			<title>Non incremental snapshot replication</title>
			<para>
The Virtuoso Server periodically evaluates a query and inserts the result into a table,
replacing the content. The source and target can be anywhere but typically will
be on different databases of which at least one is remote.
</para>
			<para>This makes a two party distributed transaction. Only one of the transaction
branches is writing, hence this goes with a one phase commit.
</para>
			<note>
				<title>Note:</title>
				<para>
This can be used to replicate between two non-Virtuoso databases.
</para>
			</note>
			<para>
The prerequisite of this mode of replication is that all tables exist.
The schema is never replicated.
</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="INC">
			<title>Incremental snapshot replication</title>
			<para>
A table can be replicated from a generic, possibly non-Virtuoso source in an
incremental fashion if the data source meets certain criteria:
</para>
			<para>
The data should come from a single table.
</para>
			<para>
The source table should have an explicit primary key.
</para>
			<para>
There source query should have the form
</para>
			<programlisting>SELECT fields FROM source_table WHERE scalar_conditions
</programlisting>
			<para>
A snapshot log on the source table should exist.
</para>
			<para>
There should be insert, delete and update triggers on the source table to update the snapshot log.
</para>
			<para>
The incremental update is done in the following way:
</para>
			<para>
All the changed records with a snaptime greater or equal from REPL_START_TIME(SN_LAST_TS) are processed.
If the record to insert already exists, then it is updated. If the record to update does not
exist in the destination table, then it is inserted. This contributes for conflict resolving.
</para>

				<title>CREATE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>CREATE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_create_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Creates a snapshot log of a native (non VDB) table and the appropriate log update triggers.
</para>
				<para>
Note that when replicating data from a remote Virtuoso a snapshot log table can be created on the
remote virtuoso and then the source and log tables can be attached into the local Virtuoso. However
the snapshot log table and the update triggers should be created manually on a non-Virtuoso data source.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
create snapshot log for Orders;
</programlisting>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="DROPLOG">
				<title>DROP SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>DROP SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_drop_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Drops a snapshot log of a table and the log update triggers.
</para>
				<para>
This results in 4 SQL commands :
</para>
				<programlisting>
drop trigger xxx_I_log;
drop trigger xxx_U_log;
drop trigger xxx_D_log;
drop table RLOG_xxx;
</programlisting>
				<para>
where xxx is the source table name (fully qualified - DB.DBA.Orders becomes DB_DBA_Orders).

				<title>PURGE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>PURGE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_purge_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
There can be old snapshot log rows which have been replayed in all the snapshots of a given source table.
These rows are no longer needed and can be purged from the snapshot log for faster operation.
</para>
				<para>
This command checks if there are any rows in SYS_REPLICATION referring to that source table and if there
are, then it deletes all the rows in the log table with SNAPTIME earlier then REPL_START_TIME(MIN(SN_LAST_TS)).
</para>
				<para>
If there are no rows in SYS_SNAPSHOT it assumes that the log is used for &quot;pull&quot; replication
and does not do anything.

</para>
				<programlisting>

				<para>
Creates a non-incremental snapshot log of the data returned by the query query_def.
</para>
				<para>
The server first checks for the existence of a table with the same name. If it does not exist,
then a table with a layout to accommodate the resultset produced by query_def is created.
</para>
				<para>
Then a entry containing query_def and tablename is added to SYS_SNAPSHOT and the destination table
is filled in with an insert into tablename query_def.

<member>
  <para><emphasis>snp_repl_tolerance_offset</emphasis> (default 15)</para>
  <para>In incremental and bi-directional snapshot time stamp of
  last replayed snapshot log entry (LAST_TS) is kept in system tables.
  LAST_TS is used to determine the starting point of the next update. 
  This value can't be used as is for the following reasons:
  <simplelist>
    <member>
      <para>Local time may be adjusted occasionally on the servers which
      participate in replication.
      </para>
    </member>
    <member>
      <para>Virtuoso snapshot replication triggers use
      <function>now()</function> function to get snapshot log entry time stamp.
      If transaction is started before updating snapshot log and ended
      after updating snapshot log is finished,
      data modifications made in this transaction will be missed.</para>
    </member>
  </simplelist>
  In order to resolve the issues mentioned above Virtuoso reads snapshot
  logs starting from LAST_TS minus some tolerance offset. The value
  of tolerance offset (in minutes) is kept in "snp_repl_tolerance_offset"
  registry variable. For the reasons mentioned above tolerance offset should be
  longer than length of any transaction which modifies published tables.
  </para>
</member>
<member>
  <para><emphasis>snp_repl_purge_offset</emphasis> (default 30)</para>
  <para>In order to prevent snapshot log entries to be replayed more than
  once Virtuoso keeps log of replayed snapshot log entries (rplog).
  Rplog entries need to be purged periodically. Virtuoso automatically
  schedules rplog purger when snapshot log for some table is created.
  All the records in rplog with time stamp less than MIN(LAST_TS) minus
  some offset are purged. The value of purge offset (in minutes) is kept in
  "snp_repl_purge_offset" registry variable. Normally, purge offset
  should be greater than tolerance offset.

			<para>

</para>
<para>

this snapshow log row.
</para>
<para>An updating procedure for incremental snapshot or bi-directional
snapshot (table case) reads records from
snapshot log table, ordered by SNAPTIME. Commits are performed each time
an updating procedure notices that SNAPTIME has changed.
In Virtuoso case (when native table is snapshot-replicated) all snapshot log
records with equal SNAPTIME belong to the same transaction and all such
records constitute almost a transaction (it is not exactly a transaction
because only the last DML operation for each primary key in the source table
is recorded in snapshot log table). So in Virtuoso case an updating procedure
commits almost per transaction on source table.
Snapshot log records are not transaction-bound in heterogeneous case however.
Nevertheless, the technique used to determine when to commit described above
prevents running out of transaction log or deadlocks even in heterogeneous
case.</para>
<para>Replay log is created on the server which performs sync (server on which
snapshot log was create in ordinary case, publisher in bi-directional snapshot
case) to handle correct snapshot log replaying. Replay log
is purged periodically using <function>REPL_PURGE_RPLOGS()</function> function
in ordinary case and <function>REPL_PURGE_URPLOGS()</function> in
bi-directional case. The calls to this functions are automatically scheduled
when snapshot log or bi-directional snapshot publication is created and
there is no need to call them manually.

		<title>Transactional Replication </title>
		<para>
The unit of replication is a publication. A publication is an ordered sequence
of transaction entries.  One database transaction can add data to
zero or more publications. The data contributed to a publication by a
transaction is appended to the publication at the time of commit.
Because commits are serialized database wide, items in a publication
have a well defined order.
</para>
		<para>
Each transaction entry in a publication has a unique sequence number
within the publication.  Each subscriber of a publication has a level of
synchronization, which is the serial number of the last transaction from the publication which this
subscriber has processed.
</para>
		<para>
Each publication has exactly one publisher and zero or more subscribers. Any
multi-master merge replication schemes will be based on this notion, with data to be
merged back into the original source regarded as a separate publication and the merge
regarded as a process between publications.
</para>
		<para>
In order to publish data for replication by others a server must have a unique
name within the group of servers participating in the replication.  This server name is
assigned to the server in its virtuoso.ini file in the DBName setting.
</para>
		<para>
To publish data the publishing server initializes a publication with the repl_publish function, where
it names the publication and assigns a log file name for it.  The server can then
start adding transactions to the publication, which can happen either under
application control or implicitly.
</para>
<tip><title>Tip</title>
<para>See the <link linkend="TransReplPublishFunctions">repl_text</link> function.</para>
</tip>
		<para>
To subscribe to publications a server must also have a distinct DBName.  It identifies
the publishing server by associating a host name and port number to its logical
name with the repl_server function.  It can then call
<function>repl_subscribe()</function>. Replication feeds from publisher
are replayed by 'dba' user by default. The default can be changed
(see <link linkend="fn_repl_subscribe">repl_subscribe()</link> function).
for each of the publications it subscribes to.  A publication is uniquely
identified on the subscriber with the publishing server name and the
publication name.  Note that several servers in a network may publish like named
publications and these will be logically distinct, having each their own distinct publisher.
</para>
		<para>
A subscriber may or may not be connected to the publisher at any point in time.
If a subscriber is connected to the publisher it may either be &apos;in sync&apos; or syncing&apos;.  In the
syncing state it is receiving transaction entries with numbers consecutive from its sync
level up until the last committed serial number committed on the server.
</para>
		<para>
At the start of the sync communication the subscriber indicates the level of the last successfully
processed transaction in the publication. The sync exchange terminates when the subscriber reaches
the last committed item on the publication. At this point the subscriber is said to be &apos;in sync&apos;.
The connection to the publisher is then maintained by default and is used to send sync information as it
becomes available.  This means that once an entry is appended to the publication by a committing
a transaction it is sent to the &apos;in sync&apos; subscribers without separate request.
</para>
		<para>
The publisher can terminate the replication feed by unilateral decision.  It will do it
if the sending of the message times out for too long or if the queue of &apos;to be sent&apos; replication
records exceeds a settable threshold.  This essentially happens with communication failures
or if the subscriber continuously processes the feed at a speed lower than the
feed production speed of the publisher.  A disconnected subscriber can reconnect at will, in
which case it enters the &apos;syncing&apos; state and will receive transactions from the point where the feed
was cut.
</para>
		<para>
A subscriber can disconnect from the publisher at any time without ill effect.

<sect2 id="pubitems">
<title>Publishable Items</title>

<para>
Tables, stored procedures and DAV collections may be added to a
transactional publication.  When a table is added, triggers are
created for capturing changes to the table.  When a procedure is
added, all calls to this procedure will be recorded in the
publication's log and the same procedure will be called on the
subscriber.  When a procedure is published in this manner, actions
performed inside the procedure are not themselves recorded even if
they touch on items that are part of a publication.  It is assumed
that the procedure on the subscriber will produce the equivalent
effect.  When a DAV collection is published, operations on direct and
indirect members of the collection are logged into the publication's
log.  When this is replayed on the subscriber, the operations are
repeated on like-named DAV resources, creating collections and
resources as needed.
</para>

<para>
When a table or procedure is added to a publication, the creating
statement is added also, so that the subscribers come to create the
table or procedure before receiving any replication operations on said
table or procedure.  Also when the table or procedure is altered, the
altering statements are added to the publication so s to be reflected
on all subscribers.  This can be overridden for procedures, since in
some cases it is desirable to have a different definition on the
subscriber.  Table constraints are also replicated, except for foreign
key constraints with tables outside the publication, since these would
not be meaningful on the subscriber, as there is no knowledge on what
tables may exist there outside of the ones in the publication.
Changes to schema on subscribers are never replicated to the
publisher, even if we had bidirectional replication.  Identity and
timestamp columns are replicated so that the values on the subscriber
are assigned by the publisher.
</para>

<para>
When a procedure is published, it is possible to specify whether the
definitions, calls or both are replicated.  Usually specifying both
calls and definition is reasonable, sometimes only calls are to be
replicated if the procedure intentionally has a different definition
in the subscriber.  This is useful for example when the subscriber
gathers statistics or maintains a data warehouse where the storage
schema is not identical with that of the publisher.  Only procedures
with input parameters can be replicated.  The rationale is that
replication is a one way stream and no return values, result sets or
output parameters can be captured by either publisher or subscriber.
Procedure calls cannot be replicated bidirectionally, these go from publisher to subscriber exclusively.
</para>

<para>
Even though replication can carry schema changes, it is in no way a means of keeping software installations in sync.  Many schema elements such as triggers are not covered and a software upgrade is more complex than can be represented by replication alone.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="errorsinreplication">
<title>Errors in Replication</title>
<para>
A statement received for replication from a publisher may encounter an
error.  All Such errors are logged into the subscriber's error log
file.  If the error is retryable, like a deadlock, retries are made
until the operation succeeds.  If Other errors are simply skipped and
replication proceeds.  A replication subscription can be permanently
broken and out of sync if for example columns are dropped from the
subscriber copy of the tables or if the subscriber runs out of disk and can replay some transactions but not all.  Note that in such situations gaps may be formed into the received transaction sequence.  In such cases, it is best to drop the
subscription, drop the tables and remake the subscription.

<title>Replication Logger Sample</title>

The logger directory in the samples in the distribution contains a simple
load balancing sample.  It implements a simplified web site hit log where there is a
count of hits maintained per user name and origin IP of each hit.
</para>
	<para>
Thus the transaction being replicated between the servers consists of incrementing
an IP's hit count and then incrementing a user's hit count.  If either
IP or user do not have a count, a row is added with a count of 1.  The transaction is
then logged for replication, so that all servers get all hits, no matter which of the
replicating servers processes the hit.

}
</programlisting>
	<para>
The application client calls wl_hit on one of the mutually replicating
servers to log an event.  The event's trace will then be propagated to all other servers.
The wl_hit_repl function does the actual work. The top level function
calls this plus logs the call with its arguments on the local server's hits publication
for distribution to other servers.

	<title>Configuration of the Sample</title>

The following sequence of calls can be used to define a network

First all the servers are identified.  Next the local server declares that it has
a publication 'hits'.  Next it subscribes to the hits publications of
all other servers.  In the process it also subscribes to itself, which signals an
error and has no other effect.

In this way all servers share one configuration.  Each server knows which of the
servers it is based on the DBName setting in its virtuoso.ini file.

This procedure will go through all subscriptions and request sync for each.
Note that the repl_sync function is called inside exec to catch any possible
exceptions, as servers may not be available etc.  For the sake of simplicity
this supplies the literal default dba login 'dba', 'dba' as authentication.

	<title>Notes on the Sample's Dynamics</title>
	<para>
When the network initially starts all the publications are at level 0 and
in sync.  When transactions are fed into the network at a sufficiently slow
rate all the servers get to process all transactions in real time.  Note that the
structure is such that every server does everybody else's work in addition to its
own. Thus the insertion rate of the network can't be expected to be higher than
that of an individual server.  However read load can be spread across servers, so
that this type of configuration is effective for balancing query load but not
for balancing update load.
</para>
	<para>
As we increase the transaction rate at each server we reach a point at which
the queue of locally committed but un-replicated transactions grows faster than
the other servers will absorb the feed.  The servers will each eventually disconnect
all synced replication to stop the queue from growing.  Once the queue that no longer
grows goes empty the subscribers get disconnected. At this
point all servers only process their own load without any other distraction.
</para>
	<para>
Next each server will notice that it is disconnected from the network and will
attempt a resync as a result of the periodic scheduled call to log_sync.
Each server will then re-establish a connection to every other server and
start resyncing.  This will lead to the network being again in
sync if the per server transaction rate slows down sufficiently to allow
replicators to catch up.  If this does not happen the syncing can stay in progress
indefinitely, until it either reaches sync or is terminated.
</para>
	<para>
Typically a server's capacity for processing local transactions is greater
than its capacity for replaying replication feed.  This is because one thread is
responsible for all replay activity while many threads can process local
transactions.
</para>
	<para>
The net result of this scheduling policy is that even a heavily replicated
network will scale to high peak loads and will automatically return to sync state
as soon as the peak is over.  If guaranteed transaction level synchronicity
must be maintained between servers then the application should not be written
using transactional replication but rather with distributed transactions,
where each commit makes sure the transaction is fully processed on each participant before
returning to the client.  This is however up to several times slower and
will stop the entire network if a single node fails.
</para>

The commit length is set at commit inside the trail mtx.
The sync message is sent inside this same trail mtx.

The commit is inside map which goes inside the trail mtx and then inside the queue mtx.
The send end check is inside the trail mtx which goes inside the queue mtx.
The map mtx can't therefore be acquired inside trail mtx (registry_set inside sub_queue_synced).
