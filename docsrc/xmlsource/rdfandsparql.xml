<abstract>
<para>
Starting with version 4.5, Virtuoso provides built-in support for SPARQL, the standard query language for RDF and the semantic web.

Adoption of SPARQL with Virtuoso is effortless, as any  existing SQL client applications and stored procedures can take advantage of SPARQL simply by using it in the place of or inside SQL queries.  Additionally, Virtuoso offers the standard SPARQL protocol to HTTP clients.
From version 5.0.7, Virtuoso can be used  as the RDF store/query processor of the Jena and Sesame RDF frameworks.
</para>

<para>
This chapter discusses Virtuoso's RDF triple storage and query capabilities. 
This discusses storing RDF data as well as mapping existing relational data into RDF for SPARQL access. Numerous  SPARQL language extensions and standard compliance are covered.
</para>

<para>In this chapter SPARQL and SPASQL are used as siblings.</para>

<sect1 id="rdfdatarepresentation"><title>Data Representation</title>
<para>This section covers how Virtuoso stores RDF triples. The IRI_ID built-in data type is introduced, along with the default table structures used for triple persistency.
These details are mostly hidden from users of RDF, thus this section is not necessary reading for typical use of Virtuoso with RDF.
</para>
<sect2 id="rdfiriidtype"><title>IRI_ID Type</title>
<para>The central notion of RDF is the IRI, or URI, which serves as the globally unique label of named nodes. The subject and predicate of a triple are always IRI's and the object may be an IRI or any other XML Schema scalar data type. In any case, an IRI is always distinct from any instance of any other data type.</para>
<para>Virtuoso supports a native IRI_ID data type, internally an unsigned 32 bit or unsigned 64 bit integer value.
Small databases can use 32 bit values but if database becomes big then the administrator should execute
<function>DB.DBA.RDF_64BIT_UPGRADE</function>() procedure that will switch to 64-bit values. This procedure takes time so if it is known in advance that the database will grow to billions of nodes then it could be convenient to upgrade it while it is empty.
An IRI_ID is never equal to any instance of any other type.</para>
<para>Thus, the object column of a table storing triples can be declared as ANY and IRI values will be distinguishable without recourse to any extra flag and IRI's will naturally occupy their own contiguous segment in the ANY type collation sequence. Indices can be defined over such columns. An IRI_ID is never automatically cast into any other type nor any other type into IRI_ID.</para>
<para>The functions iri_id_num (in i IRI_ID) and iri_id_from_num (in n INT) convert between signed integers and IRI_ID's. The function isiri_id (in i any) returns nonzero if the argument is of type IRI_ID, zero otherwise.</para>
<para>The syntax for an IRI_ID literal is <emphasis>#i&lt;NNN&gt;</emphasis> or <emphasis>#ib&lt;NNN&gt;</emphasis>, where <emphasis>&lt;NNN&gt;</emphasis> is up to 20 decimal digits. <emphasis>#i12345</emphasis> is equal to <emphasis>iri_id_from_num (12345)</emphasis> and <emphasis>#ib12345</emphasis> is equal to <emphasis>iri_id_from_num (12345) + min_64bit_bnode_iri_id ()</emphasis>.</para>	
<para>When received by a SQL client application, the ODBC driver or
interactive SQL will bind an IRI_ID to a character buffer, producing
the <emphasis>#i&lt;NNN&gt;</emphasis> syntax. When passing IRI_ID's from a client, one can pass an
integer and use the iri_id_from_num () function in the statement to
convert server side. A SQL client will normally not be exposed to
IRI_ID's since the SPARQL implementation returns IRI's in their text
form, not as internal id's. These will however be seen if reading the
internal tables directly.</para>
<note><para>Nobody, even DBA, should write directly to internal RDF tables, because some data from that tables are cached in a special way and cache is not automatically updated when content of tables has changed.</para></note>
<para><emphasis>Example</emphasis></para>
<para>The following example demonstrates IRI type usage as Virtuoso PL function parameter:</para>

<sect2 id="rdfboxtype"><title>RDF_BOX Type</title>
<para>While strings, numbers, dates and XML entities are &quot;native&quot; SQL datatypes,
RDF literal with non-default type or language have no exact matches among standard SQL types.
Virtuoso introduces a special data type called "RDF_BOX" in order to handle that cases.
Instance of RDF_BOX consists of data type, language, the content (or beginning characters of a long content)
and a possible reference to DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ table if the object is too long to be held in-line in some table or should be outlined for free-text indexing.</para>
<para>Usually applications do not need to access internals of an RDF boxes. This datatype is used in system tables but almost all SPARQL and RDF operations use standard SQL datatypes for arguments and return values.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfquadtables"><title>RDF_QUAD and other tables</title>
<para>The main tables of the default RDF storage system are:</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD (
  G IRI_ID,
  S IRI_ID,
  P IRI_ID,
  O any,
  primary key (G,S,P,O) );
create bitmap index RDF_QUAD_OGPS on DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD (O, G, P, S);
</programlisting>
<para>Each triple (more correctly, each quad) is represented by one row in RDF_QUAD.
The columns represent the graph, subject, predicate and object.
The IRI_ID type columns reference RDF_IRI, which translates the internal id to the external name of the IRI.
The O column is of type ANY.
If the O value is a non-string SQL scalar, such as a number or date or IRI, it is stored in its native binary representation.
If it is a "very short" string (20 characters or less), it is also stored "as is".
Long strings and RDF literal with non-default type or language are stored as RDF_BOX values.
Instance of rdf_box consists of data type, language, the content (or beginning characters of a long content)
and a possible reference to RDF_OBJ if the object is too long to be held in-line in this table or should be outlined for free-text indexing.
</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.RDF_PREFIX (
  RP_NAME varchar primary key,
  RP_ID int not null unique );
create table DB.DBA.RDF_IRI (
  RI_NAME varchar primary key,
  RI_ID IRI_ID not null unique );
</programlisting>
<para>These two tables store a mapping between internal IRI id's and their external string form.
A memory-resident cache contains recently used IRIs to reduce access to this table.
Function id_to_iri (in id IRI_ID) returns the IRI by its ID.
Function iri_to_id (in iri varchar, in may_create_new_id) returns an IRI_ID for given string;
if the string is not used before as an IRI then either NULL is returned or a new ID is allocated, depending on the second argument.
</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ (
  RO_ID integer primary key,
    RO_VAL varchar,
  RO_LONG long varchar,
  RO_DIGEST any
)
create index RO_VAL on DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ (RO_VAL)
create index RO_DIGEST on DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ (RO_DIGEST)
;
</programlisting>
<para>When an O value of RDF_QUAD is longer than a certain limit or should be free-text indexed, the value is stored in this table.
Depending on the length of the value, it goes into the varchar or the long varchar column.
The RO_ID is contained in rdf_box object that is stored in the O column.
Still, the truncated value of O can be used for determining equality and range matching,
even if &lt; and &gt; of closely matching values need to look at the real string in RDF_OBJ.
When RO_LONG is used to store very long value, RO_VAL contains a simple checksum of the value, to accelerate search for identical values when the table is populated by new values.
</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.RDF_DATATYPE (
    RDT_IID IRI_ID not null primary key,
    RDT_TWOBYTE integer not null unique,
    RDT_QNAME varchar );
</programlisting>
<para>The XML Schema data type of a typed string O represented as 2 bytes in the O varchar value. This table maps this into the broader IRI space where the type URI is given an IRI number.</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.RDF_LANGUAGE (
    RL_ID varchar not null primary key,
    RL_TWOBYTE integer not null unique );
</programlisting>
<para>The varchar representation of a O which is a string with language has a two byte field for language. This table maps the short integer language id to the real language name such as 'en', 'en-US' or 'x-any'.</para>
<para><emphasis>Note that unlike datatype names, language names are not URIs.</emphasis></para>
<para>A short integer value can be used in both RDF_DATATYPE and RDF_LANGUAGE tables for two different purposes. E.g. an integer 257 is for 'unspecified datatype' as well as for 'unspecified language'.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsqlmodes"><title>Short, Long and SQL Values</title>
<para>When processing an O, the SPARQL implementation may have it in one of three internal formats, called "valmodes". The below cases apply for strings:</para>
<para>The short format is the format where an O is stored in RDF_QUAD.</para>
<para>The long value is similar to short one but an rdf_box object, that consists of six fields:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>short integer id of type referencing RDT_TWOBYTE, 257   if the type is not specified,</listitem>
<listitem>the string as inlined in O or as stored in RO_VAL or   RO_LONG,</listitem>
<listitem>the RO_ID if the string is from RDF_OBJ (otherwise   zero),</listitem>
<listitem>the short integer id of language referencing RL_TWOBYTE, 257 if the language is not specified,</listitem>
<listitem>flag whether the stored string value is complete or it is only the beginning that is inlined in O.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The SQL value is the string as a narrow string representing the UTF8 encoding of the value, stripped of data type and language tag.</para>
<para>The SQL form of an IRI is the string. The long and short forms are the IRI_ID referencing RU_IRI_ID of RDF_URL.</para>
<para>For all non-string, non-IRI types, the short, long and SQL values are the same SQL scalar of the appropriate native SQL type. A SQL host variable meant to receive an O should be of the ANY type.</para>
<para>The SPARQL implementation will usually translate results to the SQL format before returning them.
Internally, it uses the shortest possible form suited to the operation. For equalities and joining, the
short form is always good. For range comparisons, the long form is needed etc. For arithmetic,
all three forms will do since the arguments are expected to be numbers which are stored as their binary
selves in O, thus the O column unaltered and uncast will do as an argument of arithmetic or numeric
comparison with, say, SQL literal constants.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsqlsparqlresolve"><title>Programatically resolving DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.O to SQL</title>
<para>This section describes how to resolve programatically the internal representation of DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.O to its SQL value.</para>
<para>When operating over RDF_QUAD table directly, in order to transform all values obtained from column
O to the explicit SQL type in a programmatic way, should be used the following hints depending on the case:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>The SQL value can be extracted as <emphasis>__ro2sq(O)</emphasis>.</listitem>
  <listitem>The datatype can be extracted as <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_DATATYPE_OF_OBJ (O)</emphasis> if IRI_ID of the type is enough or <emphasis>__ro2sq ( DB.DBA.RDF_DATATYPE_OF_OBJ(O))</emphasis></listitem>
  <listitem>The language can be extracted as <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_LANGUAGE_OF_OBJ (O)</emphasis>.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>It could be helpful to be created an Linked Data View for a custom table with formats rdfdf:default or rdfdf:default-nullable
for columns similar to O, and let SPARQL perform the rest.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfxmlschemacompat"><title>Special Cases and XML Schema Compatibility</title>
<para>We note that since we store numbers as the equivalent SQL binary type, we do not preserve the distinction of byte, boolean etc. These all become integer. If preserving such detail is for some reason important, then storage as a typed string is possible but is not done at present for reasons of compactness and performance.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfquietcast"><title>SQL Compiler Support - QUIETCAST option</title>
<para>The type cast behaviors of SQL and SPARQL are different. SQL will generally signal an error when an automatic cast fails. For example, a string can be compared to a date column if the string can be parsed as a date but otherwise the comparison should signal an error. In SPARQL, such situations are supposed to silently fail. Generally, SPARQL is much more relaxed with respect to data types.</para>
<para>These differences will be specially noticed if actual SQL data is processed with SPARQL via some sort of schema mapping translating references to triples into native tables and columns.</para>
<para>Also, even when dealing with the triple-oriented RDF_QUAD table, there are cases of joining between S and O such that the O can be a heterogeneous set of IRI's and other data whereas the S is always an IRI. The non-IRI to IRI comparison should not give cast errors but should silently fail. Also, in order to keep queries simple and easily optimizable, it should not be necessary to introduce extra predicates for testing if the O is n IRI before comparing with the S.</para>
<para>Due to these considerations, Virtuoso introduces a SQL statement option called QUIETCAST. When given in the OPTION clause of a SELECT, it switches to silent fail mode for automatic type casting.</para>
<para>The syntax is as follows:</para>
<programlisting>
SELECT ...
FROM .... OPTION (QUIETCAST)
</programlisting>
<para>This option is automatically added by the SPARQL to SQL translator. The scope is the enclosing procedure body.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfdynamiclocal"><title>Dynamic Renaming of Local IRI's</title>
<para>
    There are cases where it is desirable to have IRI's in RDF storage
    that will change to reflect a change of the host name of the containing
    store.  This is specifically true of DAV resource metadata for local
    DAV resources.
    Such IRI's must be stored prefixed with <computeroutput>local:</computeroutput>.  
</para>
<para>
    If a user application makes statements with such a URI, then these statements will be returned with local:
    substituted with a prefix taken from the context as described below.
</para>
<para>
    When returning IRI's from id's, this prefix is replaced by the Host header of the HTTP request 
    and if not running with HTTP, with the DefaultHost from URIQA.  This behavior is always in effect.
</para>

<para>
    When converting strings to IRI id's, the <computeroutput>local:</computeroutput> prefix may or may not be introduced depending on ini file and other context factors.
    If <link linkend="VIRTINI">DynamicLocal</link> defined in the [URIQA] section of the Virtuoso INI file is on and the host part of the IRI matches the Host header of the HTTP request in context or the DefaultHost if outside of HTTP context, then this is replaced with local: before looking up the IRI ID.  Even if DynamicLocal is not on and the <computeroutput>local:</computeroutput> prefix occurs in the IRI string being translated to id, the translating the IRI_ID back to the IRI name will depend on the context as described above.
</para>
<para>
    The effects of DynamicLocal = 1 can be very confusing since many names
    can refer to the exact same thing.  For example, if the DefaultHost is
    dbpedia.org,
    <computeroutput>iri_to_id ('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris') = iri_to_id ('local:///resource/Paris) </computeroutput>
    is true and so is  
    <computeroutput>'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris' = id_to_iri (iri_to_id ('local://resource/Paris'))</computeroutput>
    These hold in a SQL client context, i.e. also when connected through RDF frameworks like Jena or Sesame.
    When running a SPARQL protocol request, the Host: header influences the behavior, likewise when using web interactive SQL in Conductor.
    Also be careful when loading RDF files that may have URI's corresponding to the local host name.

<para><emphasis>Example: Using OFFSET and LIMIT</emphasis></para>
<para>
Virtuoso uses a zero-based index for OFFSET. Thus, in the example below, the query returns 
1000 rows starting from, and including, record 9001 of the result set. Note that the
default value of the MaxSortedTopRows parameter in the [Parameters] section of the virtuoso.ini configuration 
file defaults to 10000, so in this example its value will need to have been increased beforehand.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SQL>SELECT ?name
ORDER BY ?name
OFFSET 9000
LIMIT 1000
]]></programlisting>
<para>LIMIT applies to the solution resulting from the graph patterns specified in the WHERE
CLAUSE. This implies that SELECT and CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE queries will
behave a little differently. In the case of a SELECT, there is a straight
translation i.e. LIMIT 4 implies 4 records in the result set. In the
case of CONSTRUCTs where the solution is a graph (implying that the
existence of duplicates and/or unbound variables is common) LIMIT is
basically a maximum triples threshold of: [Solution Triples] x [LIMIT].

<para>The Virtuoso SPARQL query service implements the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">SPARQL Protocol for RDF</ulink>
(W3C Working Draft 25 January 2006) providing SPARQL query processing for RDF data available on the open internet.</para>
<para>The query processor extends the standard protocol to provide support for multiple output formats.
At present this uses additional query parameters.</para>
<para>Supported features include:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>Support for GET and POST requests</listitem>
<listitem>Support for a variety of transfer MIME-types, including RDF /XML and TURTLE</listitem>
<listitem>Support for a <emphasis>default-graph-uri</emphasis> parameter</listitem>
<listitem>Support for a variety of query types including CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Virtuoso also supports /sparql-graph-crud/ web service endpoint that
implements the current draft of <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/">W3C SPARQL Graph Update protocol</ulink>. 
Both /sparql /sparql-graph-crud/ endpoints use the same SPARQL user account, 
so this user should be member of SPARQL_UPDATE group in order to modify data via Graph Update protocol.
Note that /sparql/ endpoint has /sparql-auth/ variant that uses web authentication.
Similarly, /sparql-graph-crud/ has /sparql-graph-crud-auth/ variant. As
soon as user is member of SPARQL_UPDATE group, she/he can modify the stored
data via /sparql-graph-crud-auth/ as well as via /sparql-auth/ .

The /sparql-graph-crud/ endpoint is primarily for serving requests from applications, not for manual interactions via browser.

See more information in our <link linkend="sparqloauthendpointauth">SPARQL Authentication</link> section.

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="rdfsupportedprotocolendpoint"><title>Service Endpoint</title>
<para>Virtuoso uses the pre-assigned endpoints "/sparql" and "/SPARQL" as the
defaults for exposing its REST based SPARQL Web Services.</para>
<para>The port number associated with the SPARQL services is determined by the 'ServerPort' key value
in the '[HTTPServer]' section of the virtuoso.ini file. Thus, if the Virtuoso instance is configured
to listen at a none default port e.g. 8890, the SPARQL endpoints would be accessible
at http://example.com:8890/sparql/.</para>
<para>The SPARQL endpoint supports both GET and POST requests. The client chooses between GET and POST
automatically, using the length of query text as the criterion. If the SPARQL endpoint is accessed without
any URL and requisite SPARQL protocol parameters, an interactive HTML page for capturing SPARQL input will
be presented.</para>
<sect4 id="rdfsupportedprotocolendpointuricustm"><title>Customizing SPARQL Endpoint Page</title>
<para>The SPARQL Endpoint Page can now be customized using a xsl stylesheet.</para>
<para>This works by adding the following line with isql:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SQL> registry_set ('sparql_endpoint_xsl', 'http://host:port/path/isparql.xsl');
]]></programlisting>
<para>where obviously host, port, path and the name isparql.xsl can be set to anything.</para>

<para>If the query is a CONSTRUCT or a DESCRIBE then the result set
consists of a single row and a single column. The value inside is a
dictionary of triples in 'long valmode'. Note that the dictionary
object cannot be sent to a SQL client, say, via ODBC. The client may 
lose the database connection trying to fetch a result set row that
contains a dictionary object. This disconnection does not disrupt the server,
so the client may readily reconnect to the server, but the disconnected
transaction will have been rolled back.</para>

        <entry>Two separate MIME types exist for JSON: JSON serialization of results is
'application/sparql-results+json' and confirms to the draft specification "Serializing SPARQL
Query Results in JSON". JSON serialization of triples is 'application/rdf+json' and interoperable
with Talis. Sometimes a client needs a JSON but it does not know the type of query it sends to
Virtuoso web service endpoint. In this case the client can specify either one MIME-type
'application/json' or both 'application/sparql-results+json' and 'application/rdf+json' in the
"Accept" header line and Virtuoso will chose the appropriate one automatically. Similar trick
works for other sorts of result types: Virtuoso inspects the whole "Accept" header line to
find out the most appropriate return type for the given query.

format specs are issued, Virtuoso supports some obsolete variants of standard MIME types.
'text/rdf+n3', 'text/rdf+ttl', 'application/turtle' and 'application/x-turtle' are understood for
TURTLE output, 'application/x-rdf+json' and 'application/rdf+json' are for "Serializing SPARQL Query

     <title>SPARQL Anytime Queries</title>
     <para>Starting with version 6, Virtuoso offers a partial query evaluation feature that guarantees
answers to arbitrary queries within a fixed time. This is intended for use in  publicly available SPARQL
or SQL end points on large databases. This enforces a finite duration to all queries and will strive to
return meaningful partial results. Thus this provides the same security as a transaction timeout but will
be more user friendly since results will generally be returned, also for aggregate queries. Outside of a
public query service, this may also be handy when exploring a large data set with unknown properties.

<para>Earlier releases of Virtuoso secured the SPARQL endpoint via privileges assigned to the service-
specific SQL user account "SPARQL". This account was optionally granted "SPARQL_SELECT" or
"SPARQL_UPDATE" roles. By default only the  "SPARQL_SELECT" role was assigned, enabling all users
to at least perform SELECT queries. The "SPARQL_UPDATE" role must be granted to allow updates
to the Quad Store - a pre-requisite for the Virtuoso Sponger services to be functional i.e. to
allow the Sponger to populate and update the Quad Store. In Virtuoso release 5.0.7, there is a new "SPARQL_SPONGE" role
which can be assigned specifically to allow Sponger services to update the Quad Store but not 
SPARQL users via the SPARQL endpoint.</para>
<para>Restricting a user's access to specific graphs can be done using Virtuoso row-level security
functionality, via one of the Virtuoso Data Access APIs: ODBC, JDBC, ADO.Net or PL code.</para>

<sect3 id="rdfsparqlexnpointnorthwindexample"><title>Making Linked Data Views Dereferenceable - Northwind Example</title>
<para>Consider an application that makes some relational data available for SPARQL requests, as described in the <link linkend="rdfviewnorthwindexample1">first part of the Northwind Linked Data View example</link>. This may be sufficient for some clients but the IRIs of the described subjects are not dereferenceable.
This means that external SPARQL processors cannot retrieve that data using the Virtuoso Sponger or the like. It also means that if some external resources refer to the IRI of 
some Northwind subject and a user browses that resource then he cannot look at the application's data by clicking on the subject link.</para>
<para>To make RDF access complete, applications can do the following:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>Create a virtual directory</listitem>
<listitem>Instruct the server how to prepare RDF resources on demand</listitem>
<listitem>Configure rendering of RDF resources for non-RDF clients (including Web search engines)</listitem>
<listitem>Make the used ontology available</listitem>
<listitem>Provide an index or sitemap page to help users who try to browse published data but do not know the proper URLs</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The following sequence of operations demonstrates how to implement the listed features without writing any special web pages.
All requests (except the application-specific index/sitemap) will be handled by existing web service endpoints.</para>
<para>As a precaution, we erase any URL rewriting rule lists created by this example that may be in the database following a previous run of the script.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.URLREWRITE_DROP_RULELIST ('demo_nw_rule_list1', 1)

<para>Do the same for individual rewrite rules:</para>

;
DB.DBA.URLREWRITE_DROP_RULE ('demo_nw_rule4', 1)

<para>As a sanity check we ensure that there are no other similarly named rules:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SQL>SELECT signal ('WEIRD', sprintf ('Rewrite rule "%s" found', URR_RULE))

]]></programlisting>
<para>Next we create URI rewrite rules based on regular expressions by calling <link linkend="fn_urlrewrite_create_regex_rule"><function>DB.DBA.URLREWRITE_CREATE_REGEX_RULE</function></link>, so the same path will be redirected to different places depending on the MIME types the client can accept.</para>
<para>
For a given input path, that is a URI identifying a particular Linked Data entity, the rewrite rule below generates an N3 or RDF/XML representation of the entity using a CONSTRUCT
query. (Note: In the regular expression identifying the Accept: MIME types this rule applies to, i.e. in rdf.n3 and rdf.xml, each period (.) replaces a literal character
because some SPARQL web clients published before the relevant W3C recommendations produce slightly incorrect &quot;Accept:&quot; strings.)

<note><para>The request URL for the SPARQL web service looks terrible because it is URL-encoded; the sprintf format string for it is even worse! The easiest way of composing 
encoded strings of this sort is to use the Conductor UI for configuring the rewrite rules. Alternatively open the SPARQL endpoint page (assuming it supports a UI for entering queries, if no query string is specified), type in the desired CONSTRUCT or DESCRIBE statement into the web form (using some sample URI), execute it, cut the URL of the page with results
from the address line of the browser window, paste it into the script and then replace the host name with
<emphasis>^{URIQADefaultHost}^</emphasis>, every percent with double percent, the parts of the sample IRI to be substituted with <emphasis>%U</emphasis>; finally adjust the vector of replacement parameters so that its length is equal to the number of <emphasis>%U</emphasis> or other format specifiers in the template.</para></note>

<sect3 id="rdfproxyservice"><title>Sponger Proxy URI Service</title>
<para>
In certain cases, such as Ajax applications, it's prohibited to issue HTTP requests to a server other than the original server.
In other cases it is necessary to transform the content of a target to an RDF format. To this end Virtuoso Server provides a Sponger Proxy URI Service. 
This service takes as an argument a target URL and may return the target's content "as is" or the Sponger may try to transform the content and return 
an RDF representation of the target. When transforming to RDF, the RDF format (RDF/XML, N3, TURTLE etc) of the output can be forced by a URL parameter 
or by content negotiation.

When the rdf_mappers package is installed, Virtuoso reserves the path '/about/[id|html|data|rdf]/http/' for the RDF
proxy service. In the current implementation, Virtuoso defines virtual directories for HTTP requests that
come to the port specified as 'ServerPort' in the '[HTTPServer]' section of Virtuoso configuration file
and refer to the above path string. So, if the Virtuoso installation on host example.com listens for HTTP
requests on port 8080, client applications should use the 'service endpoint' string equal to
'http://example.com:8080/about/[id|html|data|rdf]/http/'.

If the rdf_mappers VAD package is not installed, then the path '/proxy/rdf/' is used for the Sponger Proxy URI Service.

<sect2 id="sparqldebug"><title>Troubleshooting SPARQL Queries</title>
<para>A short SPARQL query can be compiled into a long SQL statement,
especially if data comes from many quad map patterns. A moderately sized
application with 50 tables and 10 columns per table may create
thousands of quad map patterns for subjects spanning hundreds of different
types. An attempt to &quot;select everything&quot; from Linked Data View of
that complexity may easily create 5000 lines of SQL code. Thus it is
to be expected that some queries will be rejected even if the same
queries would work fine if the RDF data were held as physical quads in default storage, rather than 
synthesized through an Linked Data View.
</para>

<para>In addition, the SQL compiler catches typos efficiently, signalling an error if a table or column
name is unknown, efficiently catching typos. SPARQL uses IRIs that are
long and sometimes unreadable, but there is no &quot;closed
world&quot; schema of the data so a typo in an IRI is not an error; it
is simply some other IRI. So a typo in an IRI or in a namespace prefix
causes missing bindings of some triple patterns of the query and an
incomplete result, but usually no errors are reported. A typo in graph
or predicate IRI may cause the SPARQL compiler to generate code that
accesses default (quad) storage instead of a relational source or generate
empty code that accesses nothing.</para>

<para>The SQL compiler does not signal casting errors when it runs the
statement generated from SPARQL, because the generated SQL code
contains <emphasis>option (QUIETCAST)</emphasis>. This means that
mismatches between expected and actual datatypes of values stay
invisible and may cause rounding errors (e.g. integer division instead
of floating-point) and even empty joins (due to join conditions that
silently return NULL instead of returning a comparison error).</para>

<para>In other words, SPARQL queries are so laconic that there is no
room for details that let the compiler distinguish between intent
and a bug. This masks query complexity, misuse of names and
type mismatches. One may make debugging easier by making queries
longer.</para>

<para>Two very helpful debugging tools are automatic void variable
recognition and plain old code inspection. &quot;Automatic&quot; means
&quot;cheap&quot; so the very first step of debugging is to ensure
that every triple pattern of the query may in principle return
something.  This helps in finding typos when the query gets data from
Linked Data Views. It also helps when a query tries to join two disjoint
sorts of subjects. If the <emphasis>define sql:signal-void-variables
1</emphasis> directive is placed in the preamble of the SPARQL query,
the compiler will signal an error if it finds any triple pattern that cannot 
bind variables or any variable that is proved to be always
unbound. This is especially useful when data are supposed to come from an
<emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis> or <emphasis>option (soft
exclusive)</emphasis> quad map. Without one of these options, the SPARQL
compiler will usually bind variables using &quot;physical quads&quot;;
the table of physical quads may contain any rows that match any given
triple pattern; thus many errors will remain undiscovered. If the name
of a quad map pattern is known then it is possible to force the SPARQL
compiler to use only that quad map for the whole query or a
part of the query. This is possible by using the following syntax:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
QUAD MAP quad-map-name { group-pattern }
]]></programlisting>
<para>If some triple pattern inside <emphasis>group-pattern</emphasis> cannot be bound using <emphasis>quad-map-name</emphasis> or one of its descendants then <emphasis>define sql:signal-void-variables 1</emphasis> will force the compiler to signal the error.</para>

<note><para>Although it is technically possible to use <emphasis>QUAD
MAP</emphasis> to improve the performance of a query that tries to
access redundant Linked Data Views, it is much better to achieve the same
effect by providing a more restrictive query or by changing/extending
the Linked Data View. If an application relies on this trick then interoperable third-party SPARQL
clients may experience problems because they cannot use Virtuoso-specific
extensions.</para></note>

<para>
If the automated query checking gives nothing, function <function>sparql_to_sql_text</function> can be used in order to get the SQL text generated from the given query. 
Its only argument is the text of the SPARQL query to compile (without any leading SPARQL keyword or semicolon at the end). The returned value is the SQL text. The output may be long but it is the most authoritative source of diagnostic data.
</para>
<para>
When called from ISQL or an ODBC client, the return value of <function>sparql_to_sql_text</function> may be transferred as a BLOB so ISQL requires the &quot;set blobs on&quot; instruction to avoid data truncation. Even better, the SQL text can be saved to a file:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
string_to_file ('debug.sql', sparql_to_sql_text ('SELECT * WHERE { graph ?g { ?s a ?type }}'), -2);
]]></programlisting>
<para>(The -2 is to overwrite the previous version of the file, as this function may be called many times).</para>
<note><para>
When passing the query text to sparql_to_sql_text, if the query contains single quotes, each embedded single quote must be doubled up.
Use double quotes in SPARQL queries to avoid this inconvenience.
</para>
</note>
<para>As an example, let's find out why the query</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

<para>The query is next to unreadable but some comments split it into meaningful expressions. Every triple (or list of similar triples) becomes a subquery that returns fields needed to build the values of bound variables. The fields are printed wrapped by comments like

<emphasis>/*retval[*/ expression /* original variable name */
/*]retval*/</emphasis>. Names like<emphasis>"s-6-1-t0"</emphasis>
contain the source line number where a group pattern begins (6) and the serial
number of the triple (0). Comment <emphasis>/* inter-alias join cond
*/</emphasis> means that the expression which follows is the condition as
written in the declaration of the quad map pattern. Comment
<emphasis>/* filter */</emphasis> precedes expressions for FILTER
expressions in the source SPARQL. The word &quot;equiv&quot; means
&quot;equivalence class&quot;, i.e. a group of occurrences of variables
in the source query such that all occurrences are bound to the same
value. E.g. when a name repeats in many triples of a group, all its
occurrences form an equivalence class. In some cases the compiler can
prove that two variables are always equal even if the names differ - these
variables are also placed into an &quot;equiv&quot;.</para>

<para>Looking at this query, you may notice equalities like
<emphasis>sprintf_iri (...) = sprintf_iri (...)</emphasis>. That is
sub-optimal because it indicates that no index will be used to optimize the join
and that there will be one function call per row. When the variable
<emphasis>?emp</emphasis> appears in two different triples, it means
that the value of the variable is the same in both triples. The query
compares IRIs instead of comparing the arguments of <link
linkend="fn_sprintf_iri"><function>sprintf_iri</function></link>
because the format string is not proven to be a bijection. Indeed it
cannot be a bijection for <emphasis>arbitrary</emphasis> strings, but the database must reflect the 
real world. If it is assumed that the real names of persons never start with a
digit, within the <emphasis>%d%U</emphasis> format fragment, the digits will always
be distinguishable from the name; so the IRI class can be declared as a
bijection even if it is not true for arbitrary strings. The script
can then include &quot;suspicious&quot; <emphasis>option (bijection)</emphasis> as
follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create iri class sample:Employee "http://example.com/Employee/%d%U#this"
  (in employee_id integer not null, in employee_lastname varchar not null)
  option (bijection) .
]]></programlisting>

<para>Note that names of variables returned from SPARQL are always case-sensitive and no case mode rules apply to them.
Depending on the CaseMode parameter in the Virtuoso configuration file, double quotes should be used if necessary to refer to them in surrounding SQL code.
</para>
<para>
It is possible to pass parameters to a SPARQL query via a Virtuoso-specific syntax extension.
<emphasis>??</emphasis> or <emphasis>$?</emphasis> indicates a positional parameter similar to <emphasis>?</emphasis> in plain SQL. <emphasis>??</emphasis> can be used in graph patterns or anywhere in place of a SPARQL variable.
The value of a parameter should be passed in SQL form, i.e. this should be a number or a untyped string.
An IRI ID can be passed in all cases where an absolute IRI can, except the obvious case of when the variable is an argument of a function that requires string.
If the parameter is used in the 'graph', 'subject' or 'object' position of the SPARQL pattern, the string parameter is converted into an IRI automatically. In other cases an IRI string is indistinguishable from a string literal, so it is necessary to call the built-in SPARQL function <emphasis>iri()</emphasis> , e.g. <emphasis>iri (??)</emphasis>.
Using this notation, any dynamic SQL client (whether ODBC, JDBC or some other) can execute parameterized SPARQL queries, binding parameters just as with dynamic SQL.

<para>An inline SPARQL query can refer to SQL variables that are in scope in the SQL query or stored procedure containing it.
Virtuoso extends the SPARQL syntax with a special notation to this effect. A reference to SQL variable X can be written as <emphasis>?:X</emphasis> or <emphasis>$:X</emphasis>.
A reference to column <emphasis>C</emphasis> of a table or a sub-select with alias <emphasis>T</emphasis> can be written as <emphasis>?:T.C</emphasis> or <emphasis>$:T.C</emphasis>.
Both notations can be used in any place where a variable name is allowed, except the 'AS' clause described below.
</para>
<para>A column of a result set of a SPARQL SELECT can be used in SQL code inside a for statement just like any column from a SQL select.
</para>
<para>SQL rules about double-quoted names are applicable to variables that are passed to a SPARQL query or selected from one.
If a variable name contains unusual characters or should not be normalized according to SQL conventions then the
name should use double quotes for escaping. e.g., the notation <emphasis>?:"OrderLine"</emphasis> will always refer to variable or column
titled <emphasis>OrderLine</emphasis> whereas <emphasis>?:OrderLine</emphasis> can be converted to <emphasis>ORDERLINE</emphasis> or <emphasis>orderline</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>It is safer to avoid using variable names that conflict with column names of RDF system tables, esp. <emphasis>G</emphasis>, <emphasis>S</emphasis>, <emphasis>P</emphasis> and <emphasis>O</emphasis>.
These names are not reserved now but they may cause subtle bugs when an incorrect SPARQL subquery is compiled into SQL code that refers to identically named table columns.
Some of these names may be rejected as syntax errors by future Virtuoso versions.

<sect3 id="rdfcontrollingsparqloutputtypes"><title>Controlling SPARQL Output Data Types</title>
<para>The compilation of a SPARQL query may depend on an environment that is usually provided by the SPARQL protocol and which includes the default graph URI. Environment settings that come from the SPARQL protocol may override settings in the text of a SPARQL query. To let an application configure the environment for a query, SPARQL's syntax has been extended with the 'define' clause:</para>
<programlisting>
define parameter-qname parameter-value
</programlisting>
<para>Examples of supported parameters are <emphasis>output:valmode</emphasis> and <emphasis>output:format</emphasis></para>
<para>
<emphasis>output:valmode</emphasis> specifies which data types (i.e. representation) should be used for values in the result set. The default is "SQLVAL",
meaning that a query returns result set values in SQL format and behaves as a typical SQL select - IRIs and string literals
are returned as strings, making the output compatible with ODBC and the standard SQL routines. To compose triple vectors in Virtuoso PL code, an
application may need data in long format. A valmode of "LONG" means that IRIs are returned as IRI_IDs and string literals may be returned as special "RDF boxes"
even if they are actually plain strings. This may cause problems if these new datatypes are not known to the data recipient or if IRIs come from RDF
Views (in which case IRI_IDs are created on the fly and 'pollute' the database), but it can result in fewer data conversions and thus better speed if used
properly. "AUTO" disables all types of conversion for the result set, so the latter can comprise a mix of values across "SQLVAL" and "LONG" value modes, as well as
some internal representations. It is better to avoid using this mode in user applications because the output may change from version to version.
</para>
<para>If the query contains a</para>
<programlisting>
define output:valmode 'LONG'
</programlisting>
<para>clause then all returned values are in long format. e.g., the following query returns IRI_ID's instead of IRI strings.</para>
<programlisting>
SQL>SPARQL define output:valmode 'LONG' SELECT distinct ?p WHERE { graph ?g { ?s ?p ?o } };
p
----------
#i1000001
#i1000003
#i1000005
#i1000006
...
</programlisting>
<para><emphasis>output:format</emphasis> instructs the SPARQL compiler that the result of the query should be serialized into an RDF document -
that document will be returned as a single column of a single row result set.
<emphasis>output:format</emphasis> is especially useful if a SPARQL CONSTRUCT or SPARQL DESCRIBE query is executed directly via an ODBC or JDBC database connection
and the client cannot receive the resulting dictionary of triples (there's no way to transfer such an object via ODBC).
Using this option, the client can receive the document that contains the whole result set of a SELECT or the dictionary of triples of a CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE, and parse it locally.
</para>
<para>
Supported values for <emphasis>output:format</emphasis> are <emphasis>RDF/XML</emphasis> and <emphasis>TURTLE</emphasis> (or <emphasis>TTL</emphasis>).
If both <emphasis>output:valmode</emphasis> and <emphasis>output:format</emphasis> are specified, <emphasis>output:format</emphasis> has higher priority,
raising an error if <emphasis>output:valmode</emphasis> is set to a value other than <emphasis>LONG</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
When a SPARQL query is compiled, the compiler checks whether the result set is to be sent to a remote ODBC/JDBC client or used in some other way.
The compiler will automatically set <emphasis>output:format</emphasis> to <emphasis>TURTLE</emphasis> if compiling for execution by an SQL client.
</para>
<para>
The example below demonstrates how different values of <emphasis>output:format</emphasis> affect the result of SPARQL SELECT.
Note 10 rows and 4 columns in the first result, and single LONG VARCHAR in the others.
When using the ISQL client, use the 'set blobs on;' directive if fetching long texts to avoid receiving a 'data truncated' warning.

<title>API Functions</title>
<para>
SPARQL can be used inline wherever SQL can be used.
The only API functions that one needs to know are the ones for loading RDF data into the store.
Dynamic SQL client applications can issue SPARQL queries against Virtuoso through the regular SQL client API, ODBC, JDBC or any other supported API, simply by prefixing the SPARQL query with the SPARQL keyword. Parameters work just as with dynamic SQL.
Stored procedures can have SPARQL expressions inline and can declare cursors over SPARQL result sets.
</para>

<para>
Value conversions between SQL and SPARQL are most often automatic and
invisible. In some cases one needs to be aware of the different
SPARQL value representations (valmodes). SPARQL offers declarations
for specifying whether returned graphs are to be serialized as XML
or Turtle,  or whether these will be hash tables of
triples. See <link linkend="fn_dict_new"><function>dict_new()</function></link> and related functions for a description of the hash table SQL data type.
The use of dict's is convenient for further programmatic processing of graphs.
</para>

<para>RDF-related procedures use Virtuoso/PL vectors
and dictionaries to represent RDF triples and sets of triples.</para>
<para><emphasis>Valmode</emphasis> means the "format of values returned by an
expression", i.e. 'short', 'long' or 'SQL value'.</para>
<para><emphasis>Triple vector</emphasis> is a vector (array) of S, P and O, where all values are in
'long' formats, i.e. IRI_ID's for IRI values, numbers or datetimes for corresponding XMLSchema types, special &quot;RDF box&quot; objects if O is neither string nor IRI.</para>
<para><emphasis>Dictionary of triples</emphasis> or <emphasis>Hash table of triples</emphasis> is an
dictionary object made by the SQL function <emphasis>dict_new ()</emphasis> whose keys are
triple vectors and values are not specified; this is a good storage
format for an unordered set of distinct triples.</para>
<para><emphasis>Dictionary of blank node names</emphasis> is a dictionary used for tricky
processing of a number of TURTLE or RDF /XML descriptions of subgraphs
that come from a common graph. Imagine a situation where different
descriptions actually refer to the same blank nodes of the original graph
and, moreover, the application that generates these descriptions always
generates the same blank node id string for the same node. A reader of
descriptions can correctly join described subgraphs into one big
subgraph by filling in a dictionary that contains blank node id strings
as keys and IRI_ID's assigned to those strings as dependent data.
The sharing of the same node dictionary by all readers of an application will ensure that no blank node is duplicated.</para>

<para>Sometimes the default graph IRI is not known when the SPARQL query is composed. It can be added at the very last moment by providing the IRI in a 'define' clause as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
define input:default-graph-uri &lt;http://example.com&gt
]]></programlisting>
<para>Such a definition overrides the default graph URI set in query by the 'FROM ...' clause (if any).</para>
<para>The query may contain more than one <emphasis>define input:default-graph-uri</emphasis>.
The set of values of <emphasis>input:default-graph-uri</emphasis> has the highest possible priority and cannot be redefined in the rest of the text of the query by FROM clauses.</para>
<para>FROM NAMED clauses can be used multiple times in one query:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
  SELECT ?id
  FROM NAMED <http://example.com/user1.ttl>
  OPTION (get:soft "soft", get:method "GET")
  FROM NAMED <http://example.com/user2.ttl>
  OPTION (get:soft "soft", get:method "GET")
  WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?id a ?o } }
]]></programlisting>
<para>Similarly, <emphasis>define input:named-graph-uri &lt;http://example.com&gt;</emphasis> is a replacement for a FROM NAMED clause</para>
<para>
When Virtuoso receives a SPARQL request via HTTP, the value of the default graph can be set in the protocol using a <emphasis>default-graph-uri</emphasis> HTTP parameter.
Multiple occurrences of this parameter are allowed. This HTTP parameter is converted into <emphasis>define input:default-graph-uri</emphasis>.
There's similar support for <emphasis>named-graph-uri</emphasis> HTTP parameter.
For debugging purposes, graph names set in the protocol are sent back in the reply header as <emphasis>X-SPARQL-default-graph: ...</emphasis> and <emphasis>X-SPARQL-named-graph: ...</emphasis> header lines, one line per graph.
       </para>
<para>
A web service endpoint may provide different default configurations for different host names mentioned in HTTP requests.
This facility is configured via table <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST</emphasis>.
</para>
<programlisting>
create table DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST (
  SH_HOST	varchar not null primary key, -- host mask
  SH_GRAPH_URI	varchar,      -- 'default default' graph uri
  SH_USER_URI	varchar,      -- reserved for any use in applications
  SH_DEFINES	long varchar  -- additional defines for requests
)
</programlisting>
<para>
When the SPARQL web service endpoint receives a request it checks the <emphasis>Host</emphasis> HTTP header line.
This line contains zero or more target host names, delimited by commas.
For every host name in the line, the service scans the <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST</emphasis> table in search of a row containing a matching host name in <emphasis>SH_HOST</emphasis>.
The <emphasis>SH_HOST</emphasis> field acts as 'pattern' argument for the SQL string operator LIKE. If a matching row is found, the text of SPARQL request is extended.
If a default graph is not explicitly set by the HTTP parameters and <emphasis>SH_GRAPH_URI</emphasis> is not null then the default graph is set to <emphasis>SH_GRAPH_URI</emphasis>.
If <emphasis>SH_DEFINES</emphasis> is not null then it is added in front of the query; so this field is a good place for the text for any <emphasis>define</emphasis> options.
</para>
<para>SH_USER_URI is for arbitrary user data and can be used in any way by the
application that is "responsible" for the declared host.</para>
<para>
The search of <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST</emphasis> stops at the first found row, other possible matches are silently ignored.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="rdfsqlfromsparql"><title>Calling SQL from SPARQL</title>
<para>A SPARQL expression can contain calls to Virtuoso/PL functions and built-in SQL functions in both the WHERE clause and in the
result set. Two namespace prefixes, <emphasis>bif</emphasis> and <emphasis>sql</emphasis> are reserved for
these purposes. When a function name starts with the <emphasis>bif:</emphasis> namespace
prefix, the rest of the name is treated as the name of a SQL BIF (Built-In
Function). When a function name starts with the <emphasis>sql:</emphasis> namespace prefix,
the rest of the name is treated as the name of a Virtuoso/PL function owned by
DBA with database qualifier DB, e.g. <emphasis>sql:example(...)</emphasis> is
converted into <emphasis>DB.DBA."example"(...)</emphasis>.</para>

<para>In both cases,
the function receives arguments in SQL format ('SQL valmode') and
also returns the result in SQL format. The SPARQL compiler will
automatically add code for format conversion into the resulting SQL
code so SQL functions can be used even if <emphasis>define output:valmode
'LONG'</emphasis> forces the use of RDF representation in the
result set.</para>

  <para>In each pair, both procedures have the same semantics but the second one is used if and
only if the SPARQL compiler can prove that all subjects to process are
from physical storage <emphasis>(DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD)</emphasis>. Thus the second procedure
will not search for subjects in Linked Data Views.

  <para>Each procedure should return a dictionary with triples as keys and
integer 1 as values. So the dictionary is filled by calls like:

<sect2 id="rdfsparqlimplementatiotrans"><title>Transitivity in SPARQL</title>
  <para>Virtuoso SPARQL allows access to Virtuoso's SQL transitivity extension. Read the
<link linkend="transitivityinsQL">SQL section</link> for a definition of the options.</para>
  <para>The SPARQL syntax is slightly different from the SQL, although the option names
and meanings are the same.</para>
  <para>In SPARQL, the transitive options occur after a subquery enclosed in braces:</para>
  <para>The below produces all the IRI's that are the same as &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York&gt;.</para>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
SELECT ?syn
WHERE
  {
    {
      SELECT ?x ?syn
      WHERE
        {
          { ?x owl:sameAs ?syn } 
          UNION 
          { ?syn owl:sameAs ?x }
        }
    }
    OPTION ( TRANSITIVE, t_in (?x), t_out (?syn), t_distinct, t_min (0) )
    FILTER (?x = <http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York>) .
  }
  ]]></programlisting>
  <para>In this case, we provide a binding for ?x in the filter outside of the
  transitive subquery. The subquery therefore is made to run from in to
  out. The same effect would be accomplished if we bound ?syn and
  SELECT ?x, the designations of in and out are arbitrary and for
  transitive steps that can be evaluated equally well in both directions
  this makes no difference.
       </para>
  <para>The transitive subquery in the above is </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{SELECT ?syn
 WHERE
  {
    { SELECT ?x ?syn
      WHERE
       {
         { ?x owl:sameAs ?syn } 
         UNION 
         { ?syn owl:sameAs ?x}
       }
    } OPTION (TRANSITIVE, t_in (?x), t_out (?syn), t_distinct, t_min (0) )
  }
} .
  ]]></programlisting>
  <para>Leaving out the option would just look for one step of owl:sameAs.
  Making it transitive will apply the subquery to all bindings it
  produces until all are visited at least once (the t_distinct modifier).
  </para>
  <para>If the transitive step consists of a single triple pattern, there is a shorthand:</para>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[
  <alice> foaf:knows ?friend option (transitive t_min (1))
  ]]></programlisting>
  <para>will bind ?friend to all directly and indirectly found foaf:known
  individuals. If t_min had been 0, Malice&gt; would have also been in the
  generated bindings.</para>
  <para>The syntax is</para>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[
  option (transitive transitivity_option[,...])

  transitivity_option ::=  t_in (<variable_list>)

  variable_list ::= <variable> [,...]

  <para>Unlike SQL, variable names are used instead of column numbers.
  Otherwise all the options have the same meaning.</para>

  <para>Here we select all paths that start with the initial URI and pass
  through one or more sameAs statements. Each step produces a result of
  the transitive subquery. The graph where the sameAs triple was found
  is returned and used as the grouping column. In this way we see how
  many times each graph is used. Note that graphs are counted many
  times since the graphs containing immediate sameAs statements are
  counted for paths of length 1, then again as steps on paths that reach
  to their aliases and so on.</para>

transitive properties from SKOS vocabulary: Variant II</title>
<p>This example shows how to find entities that are subcategories of Protestant Churches, no deeper
than 3 levels within the concept scheme hierarchy, filtered by a specific subcategory. It demonstrates
use of inference rules, sub-queries, and filter to obtain entities associated with category:

<sect2 id="rdfsparqlimplementatioptragmas"><title>Supported SPARQL-BI "define" pragmas</title>
<para>SPARQL-BI compiler and run-time support are not isolated from environment and some used heuristics 
	are not perfect and sometimes different use cases require different behavior within same standard. 
	These reasons are seen frequently in the industry, and the solution is well known: compiler pragmas. 
	So we allow them at the beginning of any SPARQL query in form:

the query</title>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
input:default-graph-uri works like "FROM" clause;
input:named-graph-uri works like "FROM NAMED" clause;
input:default-graph-exclude works like "NOT FROM" clause;
input:named-graph-exclude works like "NOT FROM NAMED" clause.
]]></programlisting>
<para>The difference is that these pragmas have higher priority and they can be used for security 
	restrictions in combination with <code>define input:freeze</code> that blocks further changes in 
	the list of source graphs. The web service endpoint (or similar non-web application) can edit 
	the incoming query by placing list of pragmas ended with <code>input:freeze</code> in front of 
	query text. Even if the intruder will try to place some graph names, it will get compilation error, 
	not an access to the data. input:freeze disables all <code>input:grab-...</code> pragmas as well.
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem><code>input:ifp</code>: adds IFP keyword in OPTION (QUIETCAST, ...) clause in the generated 
  SQL. The value of this define is not used ATM, an empty string is safe for future extensions.</listitem>
  <listitem><code>input:same-as</code>: works like input:ifp but adds SAME_AS keyword.</listitem>
  <listitem><code>input:storage</code>: selects quad map storage to use. The value is an IRI of storage, 
  the default value is, of course, virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage. If the value is an empty string then only 
  quads from RDF_VIEW are used. This is a good choice for low-level admin procedures, for two reasons: 
  they will not interfere with any changes in virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage and they will continue to work 
  even if all compiler's metadata are corrupted, including the description of virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage 
  (define input:storage "" switches the SPARQL compiler to a small set of metadata that are built in 
  server C code and thus are very hard to corrupt by users).</listitem>
  <listitem><code>input:inference</code>: specifies the name of inference rule set to use.</listitem>
  <listitem><code>input:param (and synonyms input:params, sql:param, sql:params)</code>: declares a 
  variable name as a protocol parameter. The SPARQL query can refer to protocol parameter X via 
  variable with special syntax of name ?::X . If a query text should be made by query builder that 
  does not understand SPARQL-BI extensions then the text may contain variable ?X and define 
  input:param "X" . This does not work for positional parameters, one can not replace a reference 
  to ?::3 with ?3 and define input:param "3".</listitem>

  is not used in current implementation.</listitem>

  create individual graphs for Network Resource Fetch results, and in additional to this common routine, a copy of each 
  Network Resource Fetch result is added to the resource specified by the value of input:grab-group-destination. 
  input:grab-destination redirects loadings, input:grab-group-destination duplicates them.</listitem>
  <listitem><code>get:soft</code>: "soft" or "replacing", depending on mode of loading source graph;

  is RDF-aware and keeps results for further passing to other SPARQL queries or some low-level RDF 
  routines, the value "LONG" tells the compiler to preserve RDF boxes as is and to return IRI IDs

<para>Virtuoso's triple store supports optional full text indexing of RDF object values since version 5.0.
It is possible to declare that objects of triples with a given predicate or graph get indexed.
The graphs and triples may be enumerated or a wildcard may be used.
</para>
<para>The triples for which a full text index entry exists can be found using the <emphasis>bif:contains</emphasis>
or related filters and predicates.
</para>
<para>For example, the query:
</para>
<programlisting>
SQL>SELECT *
FROM &lt;people&gt;
WHERE
  {
    ?s foaf:Name ?name . ?name bif:contains "'rich*'".
  }
</programlisting>
<para>would match all subjects whose <emphasis>foaf:Name</emphasis> contained a word starting with Rich.
This would match Richard, Richie etc.
</para>
<para>Note that words and phrases should be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or
other non-alphanumeric chars.
</para>
<para>If the <emphasis>bif:contains</emphasis> or related predicate is applied to an object that is not
a string or is not the object of an indexed triple, no match will be found.
</para>
<para>The syntax for text patterns is identical to the syntax for the SQL contains predicate.
</para>
<para>The SPARQL/SQL optimizer determines whether the text pattern will be used to drive the query or whether it
will filter results after other conditions are applied first. In contrast to <emphasis>bif:contains</emphasis>,
regexp matching never drives the query or makes use of an index, thus in practice regexps are checked after other conditions.

<para>Whether the object of a given triple is indexed in the text index depends on indexing rules. If at least one
indexing rule matches the triple, the object gets indexed if the object is a string. An indexing rule specifies
a graph and a predicate. Either may be an IRI or NULL, in which case it matches all IRI's.
</para>
<para>Rules also have a 'reason', which can be used to group rules into application-specific sets. A triple will stop
being indexed only after all rules mandating its indexing are removed. When an application requires indexing a
certain set of triples, rules are added for that purpose. These rules are tagged with the name of the application
as their reason. When an application no longer requires indexing, the rules belonging to this application can be
removed. This will not turn off indexing if another application still needs certain triples to stay indexed.
</para>
<para>Indexing is enabled/disabled for specific graph/predicate combinations with:
</para>
<programlisting>
create function DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_ADD
  (in rule_g varchar, in rule_p varchar, in reason varchar) returns integer
</programlisting>
<programlisting>
create function DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_DEL
  (in rule_g varchar, in rule_p varchar, in reason varchar) returns integer
</programlisting>
<emphasis>Example:</emphasis>
<para>The first function adds a rule. The first two arguments are the text representation of the IRI's for the graph
and predicate. If NULL is given then all graph's or predicates match. Specifying both as NULL means that all
string valued objects will be added to a text index.
       </para>
<emphasis>Example:</emphasis>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_ADD (null, null, 'All');	
]]></programlisting>
<para>The second function reverses the effect of the first. Only a rule that has actually been added can be deleted.
Thus one cannot say that all except a certain enumerated set should be indexed.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_DEL (null, null, 'All');
]]></programlisting>
<para>The reason argument is an arbitrary string identifying the application that needs this rule.
Two applications can add the same rule.
Removing one of them will still keep the rule in effect.
If an object is indexed by more than one rule, the index data remain free from duplicates, neither index size nor speed is affected.
</para>
<para>
If <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_ADD</emphasis> detects that <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> contains quads whose graphs and/or predicates match to the new rule but which have not been indexed before then these quads are indexed automatically.
However the function <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_DEL</emphasis> does not remove indexing data about related objects.
Thus the presence of indexing data about an object does not imply that it is necessarily used in some quad that matches to some rule.
</para>
<para>The above functions return one if the rule is added or deleted and zero if the call was redundant (the rule has been added before or there's no rule to delete).

<note><title>Note:</title><para>It is advisable to upgrade to the latest version of Virtuoso before adding free-text rules for the first time.
This is especially the case if large amounts of text are to be indexed. The reason is that the free-text index on RDF may be changed in future versions
and automatic upgrading of an existing index data into the new format may take much more time than indexing from scratch.</para></note>
<para>The table <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RULES</emphasis> stores list of free-text index configuration rules.

]]></programlisting>
<para>
Applications may read from this table but they should not write to it directly.
Duplications in the rules do not affect the speed of free-text index operations because the content of the table is cached in memory in a special form.
Unlike the use of configuration functions, directly writing to the table will not update the in-memory cache.
</para>
<para>
The table is convenient to search for rules added by a given application.
If a unique identification string is used during installation of an application when rules are added then it's easy to remove those rules
as part of any uninstall routine.
</para>

<sect3 id="rdfsparqlruletimeindexing"><title>Time of Indexing</title>
<para>The triple store's text index is in manual batch mode by default. This means that changes in triples are periodically
reflected in the text index but are not maintained in strict synchrony. This is much more efficient than keeping the
indices in constant synchrony. This setting may be altered with the <emphasis>db.dba.vt_batch_update</emphasis> stored procedure.
</para>
<para>To force synchronization of the RDF text index, use:
</para>
<programlisting>
DB.DBA.VT_INC_INDEX_DB_DBA_RDF_OBJ ();
</programlisting>
<para>To set the text index to follow the triples in real time, use:
</para>
<programlisting>

</programlisting>
<para>To set the text index to be updated every 10 minutes, use:

</programlisting>
<para>To make the update always manual, specify NULL as the last argument above.
</para>
<para>
One problem related to free-text indexing of <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> is that some applications (e.g. those that import billions of triples) may set off triggers.
This will make free-text index data incomplete.
Calling procedure <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ_FT_RECOVER ()</emphasis> will insert all missing free-text index items by dropping and re-inserting every existing free-text index rule.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfviewsandfreetext"><title>Free-Text Indexes on Linked Data Views</title>
<para>
If an <emphasis>O</emphasis> field of a quad map pattern gets its value from a database column that has a free text index then this index can be used in SPARQL for efficient text searching. As a variation of this facility, the free-text index of another table may be used.
</para>
<para>
If a statement of a quad map pattern declaration starts with a declaration of table aliases, the table alias declaration may include the name of a table column that should have a text index.
For example, consider the possibility of using a free-text index on the content of DAV resources stored in the DAV system tables of Virtuoso:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
prefix mydav: <...>
create quad storage mydav:metadata
FROM WS.WS.SYS_DAV_RES as dav_resource text literal RES_CONTENT
...
  {
    ...
    mydav:resource-iri (dav_resource.RES_FULL_PATH)
        a mydav:resource ;
        mydav:resource-content dav_resource.RES_CONTENT ;
        mydav:resource-mime-type dav_resource.RESTYPE ;
    ...
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The clause <emphasis>text literal RES_CONTENT</emphasis> grants the SPARQL compiler permission to use a free-text index for objects that are literals composed from column <emphasis>dav_resource.RES_CONTENT</emphasis>. This clause also allows choosing between <emphasis>text literal</emphasis> (supports only the <emphasis>contains()</emphasis> predicate) and <emphasis>text xml literal</emphasis> (supports both <emphasis>contains()</emphasis> and <emphasis>xcontains()</emphasis>) text indexes.
It is important to understand that the free-text index will produce results using raw relational data.
If a literal class transformation changes the text stored in the column then these changes are ignored by free-text search.
e.g. if a transformation concatenates a word to the value of the column, but the free-text search will not find this word.
</para>
<para>
The free-text index may be used in a more sophisticated way. Consider a built-in table <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> that does not have a free-text index.
Moreover, the table does not contain the full values of all objects; the <emphasis>O</emphasis> column contains &quot;short enough&quot; values inlined, but long and special values are represented by links to the <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ</emphasis> table.
The RDF_OBJ table, however, has free-text index that can be used.
The full declaration of the built-in default mapping for default storage could be written this way:
   </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
-- Important! Do not try to execute on live system
-- without first changing the quad storage and quad map pattern names!

SPARQL
create virtrdf:DefaultQuadMap as
graph rdfdf:default-iid-nonblank (DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.G)
subject rdfdf:default-iid (DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.S)
predicate rdfdf:default-iid-nonblank (DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.P)
object rdfdf:default (DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.O)

create quad storage virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage
FROM DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD as physical_quad
FROM DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ as physical_obj text xml literal RO_DIGEST of (physical_quad.O)
WHERE (^{physical_quad.}^.O = ^{physical_obj.}^.RO_DIGEST)
  {
    create virtrdf:DefaultQuadMap as
      graph rdfdf:default-iid-nonblank (physical_quad.G)
      subject rdfdf:default-iid (physical_quad.S)
      predicate rdfdf:default-iid-nonblank (physical_quad.P)
      object rdfdf:default (physical_quad.O) .
 }
;
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The reference to the free-text index is extended by clause <emphasis> of (physical_quad.O)</emphasis>.
This means that the free-text on <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ.RO_DIGEST</emphasis> will be used when the object value comes from <emphasis>physical_quad.O</emphasis> as if <emphasis>physical_quad.O</emphasis> were indexed itself.
If a SPARQL query invokes <emphasis>virtrdf:DefaultQuadMap</emphasis> but contains no free-text criteria then only <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> appears in the final SQL statement and no join with <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ</emphasis> is made.
Adding a free-text predicate will add <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ</emphasis> to the list of source tables and a join condition for <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD.O</emphasis> and <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ.RO_DIGEST</emphasis>; and it will add <emphasis>contains (RO_DIGEST, ...)</emphasis> predicate, rather than <emphasis>contains (O, ...)</emphasis>.
As a result, &quot;you pay only for what you use&quot;: adding free-text index to the declaration does not add tables to the query unless the index is actually used.
</para>
<para>
Boolean functions <function>bif:contains</function> and <function>bif:xcontains</function> are used 
for objects that come from Linked Data Views as well as for regular &quot;physical&quot; triples.
Every function takes two arguments and returns a boolean value. The first argument is an local variable.
The argument variable should be used as an object field in the group pattern where the filter condition is placed.
Moreover, the occurrence of the variable in an object field should be placed <emphasis>before</emphasis> the filter.
If there are many occurrences of the variable in object fields then the free-text search is associated with the rightmost occurrence that is still to the left of the filter.
The triple pattern that contains the rightmost occurrence is called the &quot;intake&quot; of the free-text search.
When the SPARQL compiler chooses the appropriate quad map patterns that may generate data matching the intake triple pattern, it skips quad map patterns that have no declared free-text indexes, because nothing can be found by free-text search in data that have no free-text index.
Every quad map pattern that has a free-text pattern will ultimately produce an invocation of the SQL <link linkend="containspredicate">contains</link> or <link linkend="xcontainspredicate">xcontains</link> predicate, so the final result of a free-text search may be a union of free-text searches from different quad map patterns.
</para>
<para>
The described logic is important only in very complicated cases, whereas simple queries are self-evident:
   </para>

       <para>Starting with version 5.0, Virtuoso supports the
<ulink url="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/SPARQL-Update.html">SPARQL/Update</ulink> extension to SPARQL.
This is sufficient for most of routine data manipulation operations. If the <emphasis>SPARQL_UPDATE</emphasis>

executed via the SPARQL web service endpoint as well as by data querying.
       </para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="rdfsparulfunc"><title>Manage RDF Storage</title>
       <para>Two functions allow the user to alter RDF storage by inserting or deleting all
triples listed in some vector. Both functions receive the IRI of the graph that should be altered and
a vector of triples that should be added or removed. The graph IRI can be either an IRI ID or a string.
The third optional argument controls the transactional behavior - the parameter value is
passed to the <link linkend="fn_log_enable"><function>log_enable</function></link> function.
The return values of these functions are not defined and should not be used by applications.
       </para>
       <programlisting>
create function DB.DBA.RDF_INSERT_TRIPLES (in graph_iri any, in triples any, in log_mode integer := null)
create function DB.DBA.RDF_DELETE_TRIPLES (in graph_iri any, in triples any, in log_mode integer := null)
       </programlisting>
       <para>Simple operations may be faster if written as low-level SQL code instead of using SPARUL.
The use of SPARQL DELETE is unnecessary in cases where the better alternative is for the application to delete from RDF_QUAD
using simple SQL filters like:
       </para>
       <programlisting>
DELETE FROM DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD
WHERE G = DB.DBA.RDF_MAKE_IID_OF_QNAME (
    'http://local.virt/DAV/sparql_demo/data/data-xml/source-simple2/source-data-01.rdf' );
       </programlisting>
       <para>On the other hand, simple filters does not work when the search criteria refer to triples
that are affected by the modification. Consider a function that deletes all triples whose subjects
are nodes of type 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person'. Type information is stored in triples that
will be deleted, so the simplest function is something like this:
       </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

{
  declare pdata_dict, pdata_array any;
-- Step 1: select everything that should be deleted

      WHERE { graph ?:foaf_graph {
              ?s ?p ?o . ?s rdf:type <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>
            } }
      ));
-- Step 2: delete all found triples
  pdata_array := dict_list_keys (pdata_dict, 1);
  RDF_DELETE_TRIPLES (foaf_graph, pdata_array);
};

       <para>From Virtuoso 5.0 onwards, applications can use SPARUL to do the same in a more convenient way:

<sect2 id="sparqlbi"><title>Business Intelligence Extensions for SPARQL</title>
<para>
Virtuoso extends SPARQL with expressions in results, subqueries, aggregates and grouping.
These extensions allow a straightforward translation of arbitrary SQL queries to SPARQL.
This extension is called  "SPARQL BI", because the primary objective is to match needs of Business Intelligence.
The extended features apply equally to querying physical quads or relational tables mapped through Linked Data Views.
  </para>
<note><para>In this section, many examples use the TPC-H namespace. You may test them on your local demo database.
They use data from the TPC-H dataset that is mapped into a graph with an IRI of the form
http://example.com/tpch. When testing, you should replace the fake host name &quot;example.com&quot; with the host name of your own installation
verbatim, that is as specified in the &quot;DefaultHost&quot; parameter in the [URIQA] section of the Virtuoso configuration file.</para></note>
<sect3 id="rdfsparqlaggregate"><title>Aggregates in SPARQL</title>
<para>Virtuoso extends SPARQL with SQL like aggregate and "group by" functionality. This functionality is
also available by embedding SPARQL text inside SQL, but the SPARQL extension syntax has the benefit
of also working over the SPARQL protocol and of looking more SPARQL-like.
</para>
<para>The supported aggregates are <emphasis>COUNT</emphasis>, <emphasis>MIN</emphasis>,
<emphasis>MAX</emphasis>, <emphasis>AVG</emphasis> and <emphasis>SUM</emphasis>. These can take an
optional <emphasis>DISTINCT</emphasis> keyword. These are permitted only in the selection part of a
select query. If a selection list consists of a mix of variables and aggregates, the non-aggregate
selected items are considered to be grouping columns and a <emphasis>GROUP BY</emphasis> over them is implicitly added
at the end of the generated SQL query. Virtuoso also supports explicit syntax for
<emphasis>GROUP BY</emphasis>, <emphasis>ORDER BY</emphasis>, <emphasis>LIMIT</emphasis> and <emphasis>OFFSET</emphasis>.
There is no explicit syntax for <emphasis>HAVING</emphasis> in Virtuoso SPARQL.
</para>
<para>If a selection consists of aggregates exclusively, the result set has one row with the values
of the aggregates. If there are aggregates and variables in the selection, the result set has as many
rows as there are distinct combinations of the variables; the aggregates are then calculated over each
such distinct combination, as if there were a SQL GROUP BY over all non-aggregates.
The implicit grouping pays attention to all subexpressions in the return list; say, if a result column expression is <code>(?x * max (?y))</code> then
<code>?y</code> is aggregated and <code>?x</code> is not so it is grouped by ?x.
This also means that if a result column expression is <code>(bif:year (?shipdate))</code> then a group is made for each distinct <code>?shipdate</code>,
i.e. up to 366 groups for each distinct year.
If you need one group per year, write explicit <code>GROUP BY (bif:year (?shipdate))</code>.

</para>
<para>With the count aggregate the argument may be either <emphasis>*</emphasis>, meaning counting all rows, or a variable
name, meaning counting all the rows where this variable is bound. If there is no implicit <emphasis>GROUP BY</emphasis>,
there can be an optional <emphasis>DISTINCT</emphasis> keyword before the variable that is the argument of an aggregate.
  </para>
<para>There is a special syntax for counting distinct combinations of selected variables. This is:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT COUNT DISTINCT ?v1 ... ?vn
  FROM ....
]]></programlisting>
<para>User-defined aggregate functions are not supported in current version of the SPARQL compiler.</para>
<sect4 id="rdfsparqlaggregatepathexpressions"><title>Path Expressions</title>
<para>Virtuoso has support for paths consisting of dereferencing properties in SPARQL. Virtuoso allows
simple paths in expressions and has a separate feature for transitivity:</para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>S+&gt;P: for "one or many values of P of S"</listitem>
  <listitem>S*&gt;P: for "zero or many values of P of S", so *&gt; may form a LEFT OUTER JOIN whereas +&gt; forms an INNER JOIN.</listitem>
  <listitem>S|&gt;P: is reserved for potential "single value of P of S or an error if there are many values"</listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
<para>If this property is set (for example by an Linked Data View) then +&gt; should be used.</para>

<para><emphasis>Simple Example</emphasis></para>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[

   <para><emphasis>Example: A dataset of people, some duplicated</emphasis></para>
   <para>Suppose there is a dataset with many people, some of them sharing the same name. To list them we would, ideally, execute the query:
   </para>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[
  SPARQL
SELECT DISTINCT
 (?name) ?person ?mail
 WHERE {
   ?person rdf:type foaf:Person .
   ?person foaf:name ?name .
   ?person foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?mail
    }
  ]]></programlisting>
   <para>Unfortunately, the facility to apply DISTINCT to a part of the result set row (i.e. to ?name) does not currently exist.
   (Although the above form is permitted, it's interpreted as being identical to 'SELECT DISTINCT ?name, ?person, ?mail WHERE ...')
   If there's demand for such a feature then we may introduce an aggregate called, say, SPECIMEN, that will return the very first of the aggregated values. e.g.:
   </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
SELECT ?name (specimen(?person)) (specimen(?mail))
      WHERE
        {
    ?person rdf:type foaf:Person .
    ?person foaf:name ?name .
    ?person foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?mail
  }
]]></programlisting>
   <para>As a workaround to this limitation, the MIN aggregate can be used, provided duplicates are few and there's no requirement
   that ?person should correspond to ?mail
(i.e. the result should contain some person node and some mail node but they don't have to be connected by foaf:mbox_sha1sum):
   </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
SELECT ?name (min(?person)) (min(?mail))
      WHERE
        {
    ?person rdf:type foaf:Person .
    ?person foaf:name ?name .
    ?person foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?mail
}
]]></programlisting>
   <para>Otherwise, a complicated query is needed:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
SELECT
 ?name
 ((SELECT (min (?person3))
     WHERE {
         ?person3 rdf:type foaf:Person .
         ?person3 foaf:name ?name .
         ?person3 foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?mail } )) as ?person
 ?mail
 WHERE {
     { SELECT distinct ?name
       WHERE {
           ?person1 rdf:type foaf:Person .
           ?person1 foaf:name ?name .
           ?person1 foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?mail1 } }
     { SELECT ?name (min(?mail2)) as ?mail
       WHERE {
           ?person2 rdf:type foaf:Person .

</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfsparqlarrowop"><title>Pointer Operator (<emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>*&gt;</emphasis>)</title>
<para>
When expressions occur in result sets, many variables are often introduced only for the purpose of passing a value from a triple pattern to the result expression.
This is inconvenient because many triple patterns are trivial. The presence of large numbers of variable names masks &quot;interesting&quot; variables that are used in more than once in pattern and which establish logical relationships between different parts of the query.
As a solution we introduce pointer operators.</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> (pointer) operator allows referring to a property value without naming it as a variable and explicitly writing a triple pattern. We can shorten the example above to:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[SPARQL
prefix tpch: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/tpch#>
SELECT ?l+>tpch:linestatus count(*) sum(?l+>tpch:lineextendedprice)
FROM <http://localhost.localdomain:8310/tpch>
WHERE { ?l a tpch:lineitem }]]></programlisting>
<para>
The <emphasis>?subject+&gt;propertyname</emphasis> notation is equivalent to having a triple pattern <emphasis>?subject propertyname ?aux_var</emphasis> binding an auxiliary variable to the mentioned property of the subject, within the group pattern enclosing the reference.
For a SELECT, the enclosing group pattern is considered to be the top level pattern of the where clause or, in the event of a union, the top level of each term of the union.
Each distinct pointer adds exactly one triple pattern to the enclosing group pattern. Multiple uses of <emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> with the same arguments do not each add a triple pattern.
(Having multiple copies of an identical pattern might lead to changes in cardinality if multiple input graphs were being considered.
If a lineitem had multiple discounts or extended prices, then we would get the cartesian product of both.)
</para>
<para>
If a property referenced via <emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> is absent, the variable on the left side of the operator is not bound in the enclosing group pattern because it should be bound in all triple patterns where it appears as a field, including implicitly added patterns.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>?subject*&gt;propertyname</emphasis> notation is introduced in order to access optional property values. It adds an OPTIONAL group <emphasis>OPTIONAL { ?subject propertyname ?aux_var }</emphasis>, not a plain triple pattern, so the binding of ?subject is not changed even if the object variable is not bound. If the property is set for all subjects in question then the results of <emphasis>*&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> are the same. All other things being equal, the <emphasis>+&gt;</emphasis> operator produces better SQL code than <emphasis>*&gt;</emphasis> so use <emphasis>*&gt;</emphasis> only when it is really needed.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfsparqlnesting"><title>Subqueries in SPARQL</title>
<para>
Pure SPARQL does not allow binding a value that is not retrieved through a triple pattern.
We lift this restriction by allowing expressions in the result set and providing names for result columns.
We also allow a SPARQL SELECT statement to appear in another SPARQL statement in any place where a group pattern may appear.
The names of the result columns form the names of the variables bound, using values from the returned rows.
This resembles derived tables in SQL.</para>
<para>
For instance, the following statement finds the prices of the 1000 order lines with the biggest discounts:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[SPARQL
define sql:signal-void-variables 1
prefix tpch: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/tpch#>
SELECT ?line ?discount (?extendedprice * (1 - ?discount)) as ?finalprice
FROM <http://localhost.localdomain:8310/tpch>
WHERE
  {
    ?line a tpch:lineitem ;
    tpch:lineextendedprice ?extendedprice ;
    tpch:linediscount ?discount .
  }
ORDER BY DESC (?extendedprice * ?discount)
LIMIT 1000]]></programlisting>

<para>
After ensuring that this query works correctly, we can use it to answer more complex questions.
Imagine that we want to find out how big the customers are who have received the biggest discounts.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[SPARQL
define sql:signal-void-variables 1
prefix tpch: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/tpch#>
SELECT ?cust sum(?extendedprice2 * (1 - ?discount2)) max (?bigdiscount)
FROM <http://localhost.localdomain:8310/tpch>
WHERE
  {
    {
      SELECT ?line (?extendedprice * ?discount) as ?bigdiscount
      WHERE {
        ?line a tpch:lineitem ;
          tpch:lineextendedprice ?extendedprice ;
          tpch:linediscount ?discount . }
      ORDER BY DESC (?extendedprice * ?discount)
      LIMIT 1000
    }
    ?line tpch:has_order ?order .
    ?order tpch:has_customer ?cust .
    ?cust tpch:customer_of ?order2 .
    ?order2 tpch:order_of ?line2 .
    ?line2 tpch:lineextendedprice ?extendedprice2 ;
      tpch:linediscount ?discount2 .
  }
ORDER BY (SUM(?extendedprice2 * (1 - ?discount2)) / MAX (?bigdiscount))]]></programlisting>

<para>
The inner select finds the 1000 biggest (in absolute value) discounts and their order lines. For each line we find orders of it, and the customer. For each customer found, we find all the orders he made and all the lines of each of the orders (variable ?line2).</para>
<para>
Note that the inner select does not contain FROM clauses. It is not required because the inner select inherits the access permissions of all the outer queries. It is also important to note that the internal variable bindings of the subquery are not visible in the outer query; only the result set variables are bound. Similarly, variables bound in the outer query are not accessible to the subquery.</para>
<para>
Note also the declaration <emphasis>define sql:signal-void-variables 1</emphasis> that forces the SPARQL compiler to signal errors if some variables cannot be bound due to misspelt names or attempts to make joins across disjoint domains. These diagnostics are especially important when the query is long.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfsparqlbackq"><title>Expressions in Triple Patterns</title>
<para>In addition to expressions in filters and result sets, Virtuoso allows the use of expressions in triples of a
CONSTRUCT pattern or WHERE pattern - an expression can be used instead of a constant or a variable name for a subject, predicate or object.
When used in this context, the expression is surrounded by backquotes.</para>

<para><emphasis>Example: With a WHERE Clause:</emphasis></para>
<para>The following example returns all the distinct 'fragment' parts of all subjects in all graphs that have some predicate whose value is equal to 2+2.</para>

<sect2 id="rdfgraphsecuritygroups"><title>RDF Graph Groups</title>
<para>In some cases, the data-set of a SPARQL query is not known at compile time. It is possible to pass
IRIs of source graphs via parameters, but the method is not perfect as:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>not all protocols are suitable for parameter passing, and no one is an interoperable standard</listitem>
  <listitem>passing list of IRIs as a parameter will usually require the use of Virtuoso-specific functions
in the text of SPARQL query, that's bad for some query builders.</listitem>
  <listitem>lack of knowledge about actual graphs may damage query optimization</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>It would be nice to create named lists of graphs and a clause like "SELECT from all graph names of the specified list".
<emphasis>"Graph groups"</emphasis> serve for this purpose. That is Virtuoso-specific SPARQL extension that let create a named list of IRIs such that
if name of the list is used in <emphasis>FROM</emphasis> clause like <emphasis>IRI</emphasis> of default
graph then it is equivalent to list of <emphasis>FROM</emphasis> clauses, one clause for each item of the
list.</para>
<para>Internally, descriptions of graph groups are kept in two tables:</para>
<emphasis>Table of graph groups:</emphasis>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create table DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP (
  RGG_IID IRI_ID not null primary key,	-- IRI ID of RGG_IRI field
  RGG_IRI varchar not null,		-- Name of the group
  RGG_MEMBER_PATTERN varchar,		-- Member IRI pattern
  RGG_COMMENT varchar			-- Comment
  )
create index RDF_GRAPH_GROUP_IRI on DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP (RGG_IRI)

<para><emphasis>Table of contents of groups:</emphasis></para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[

  RGGM_MEMBER_IID IRI_ID not null,	-- IRI_ID of the group member
  primary key (RGGM_GROUP_IID, RGGM_MEMBER_IID)
  )
;
]]></programlisting>

<para>Fields <emphasis>RGG_MEMBER_PATTERN</emphasis> and <emphasis>RGG_COMMENT</emphasis> are not used by system internals but applications may wish to write their data there for future reference.
<emphasis>RGG_COMMENT</emphasis> is supposed to be human-readable description of the group and <emphasis>RGG_MEMBER_PATTERN</emphasis> may be useful for functions that automatically add
IRIs of a given graph to all graph groups such that the graph IRI string match <emphasis>RGG_MEMBER_PATTERN</emphasis> regexp pattern.
</para>
<para>A dictionary of all groups and their members is cached in memory for fast access.
Due to this reason, applications may read these tables and modify <emphasis>RGG_MEMBER_PATTERN</emphasis> and <emphasis>RGG_COMMENT</emphasis> if needed but not change other fields directly.
The following API procedures makes changes in a safe way:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP_CREATE (
  in group_iri varchar,
  in quiet integer,
  in member_pattern varchar := null,
  in comment varchar := null)
]]></programlisting>

<para>That creates a new empty graph group. An error is signaled if the group exists already and quiet
parameter is zero.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP_INS (in group_iri varchar, in memb_iri varchar)
DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP_DEL (in group_iri varchar, in memb_iri varchar)
]]></programlisting>


<para>These two are to add or remove member to an existing group. Double insert or removal of not a member
will not signal errors, but missing group will.be signaled.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.RDF_GRAPH_GROUP_DROP (
  in group_iri varchar,
  in quiet integer)
]]></programlisting>

<para>That removes graph group. An error is signaled if the group did not exist before the call and quiet
parameter is zero.</para>

<para>Graph groups are <emphasis>"macro-expanded"</emphasis> only in FROM clauses and have no effect on
FROM NAMED or on GRAPH &lt;IRI&gt; {...} . Technically, it is not prohibited to use an IRI as both plain
graph IRI and graph group IRI in one storage but this is confusing and is not recommended.</para>

<para>Graph groups can not be members of other graph groups, i.e. the IRI of a graph group can appear in the
list of members of some group but it will be treated as plain graph IRI and will not cause recursive
expansion of groups.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfgraphsecuritynotfrom"><title>NOT FROM and NOT FROM NAMED Clauses</title>
<para>In addition to standard FROM and FROM NAMED clauses, Virtuoso extends SPARQL with NOT FROM and NOT
FROM NAMED clauses of "opposite" meaning.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT ... NOT FROM <x> ... WHERE {...}
]]></programlisting>

<para>means "SELECT FROM other graphs, but not from the given one".
This is especially useful because NOT FROM supports graph groups (NOT FROM NAMED supports only plain graphs).
So if</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[

]]></programlisting>

<para>is a graph group of all graphs with confidential data about users then</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[

<para>will be restricted only to insecure data.</para>

<para>NOT FROM overrides any FROM and NOT FROM NAMED overrides any FROM NAMED, the order of clauses in the
query text is not important.</para>

<para>The SPARQL web service endpoint configuration string may contain pragmas
<emphasis>input:default-graph-exclude</emphasis> and <emphasis>input:named-graph-exclude</emphasis> that
become equivalent to NOT FROM and NOT FROM NAMED clauses like <emphasis>input:default-graph-uri</emphasis>
and <emphasis>input:named-graph-uri</emphasis> mimics FROM and FROM NAMED.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfgraphsecurity"><title>Graph-Level Security</title>
<para>Virtuoso supports graph-level security for "physical" RDF storage. That is somewhat similar to table
access permissions in SQL. However, the difference between SPARQL and SQL data models results in totally
different style of security administration. In SQL, when new application is installed it comes with its own
set of tables and every query in its code explicitly specifies tables in use. Security restrictions of two
applications interfere only if applications knows each other and are supposedly designed to cooperate. It
is possible to write an application that will get list of available tables and retrieve data from any given
table but that is a special case and it usually requires DBA privileges.</para>

<para>In SPARQL, data of different applications shares one table and the query language allows to select data
of all applications at once. This feature makes SPARQL convenient for cross-application data integration. At
the same time, that become a giant security hole if any sensitive data are stored.</para>

<para>A blind copying SQL security model to SPARQL domain would result in significant loss of performance or
weak security or even both problems at the same time. That is why SPARQL model is made much more restrictive,
even if it becomes inconvenient for some administration tasks.</para>

<para>Graph-level security does not replace traditional SQL security. A user should become member of
appropriate group (SPARQL_SELECT, SPARQL_SPONGE or SPARQL_UPDATE) in order to start using its graph-level
privileges.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfgraphsecurityunddefperm"><title>Understanding Default Permissions</title>

<para>In relational database, default permissions are trivial. DBA is usually the only account that can
access any table for both read and write. Making some table public or private does not affect applications
that do not refer that table in the code. Tables are always created before making security restrictions on
them.</para>

<para>Chances are very low that an application will unintentionally create some table and fill in with
confidential data. There are no unauthenticated users, any client has some user ID and no one user is
"default user" so permissions of any two users are always independent.</para>

<para>SPARQL access can be anonymous and graphs can be created during routine data manipulation.
For anonymous user, only public resources are available. Thus "default permissions" on some or all graphs are
actually permissions of "nobody" user, (the numeric ID of this user can be obtained by http_nobody_uid()
function call). As a consequence, there's a strong need in "default permission" for a user, this is the only
way to specify what to do with all graphs that does not exist now it might exist in some future.
</para>

<para>An attempt to make default permissions wider than specific is always potential security hole in SPARQL,
so this is strictly prohibited.</para>

<para>Four sorts of access are specified by four bits of an integer "permission bit-mask", plain old UNIX
style:</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Bit 1 permits read access.</listitem>
  <listitem>Bit 2 permits write access via SPARUL and it's basically useless without bit 1 set.</listitem>
  <listitem>Bit 4 permits write access via "RDF sponge" methods and it's basically useless
without bits 1 and 2 set.</listitem>
  <listitem>Bit 8 allows to obtain list of members of graph group; an IRI can be used as graph IRI and as
graph group IRI at the same time so bit 8 can be freely combined with any of bits 1, 2 or 4.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Note that obtaining the list of members of a graph group does not grant any access permissions to
triples from member graphs. It is quite safe to mix secure and public graphs in one graph group.</para>

<para>When a SPARQL query should check whether a given user have permission to access a given graph then
the order of checks is as follows:</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>permissions of the user on the specific graph;</listitem>
  <listitem>default permissions of the user on all graphs;</listitem>
  <listitem>public permissions on the specific graph;</listitem>
  <listitem>public permissions on all graphs</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>If no one above mentioned permission is set then the access is "read/write/sponge/list".</para>
<para>For "nobody" user, steps 3 and 4 become exact copies of steps 1 and 2 so they are skipped.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfgraphsecurityintconfsec"><title>Initial Configuration of SPARQL Security</title>

  <listitem>Step3: Configure trusted users, such as administrative DBA-like accounts, and to specify their
permissions on all graphs.</listitem>
  <listitem>Step 4: Some additional right can be granted to some specific users on some specific graphs.</listitem>

<sect1 id="rdfviews"><title>Linked Data Views over RDBMS Data Source</title>
<para>
Linked Data Views map relational data into RDF and allow customizing RDF representation of locally stored RDF data.
To let SPARQL clients access relational data as well as physical RDF graphs in a single query, we introduce a declarative Meta Schema Language for mapping SQL Data to RDF Ontologies.
As a result, all types of clients can efficiently access all data stored on the server.
The mapping functionality dynamically generates RDF Data Sets for popular ontologies such as SIOC, SKOS, FOAF, and ATOM/OWL without disruption to the existing database infrastructure of Web 1.0 or Web 2.0 solutions.
Linked Data Views are also suitable for declaring custom representation for RDF triples, e.g. property tables, where one row holds many single-valued properties.
</para>
<sect2 id="rdfviewsintro"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
The Virtuoso Linked Data Views meta schema is a built-in feature of Virtuoso's SPARQL to SQL translator.
It recognizes triple patterns that refer to graphs for which an alternate representation is declared and translates these into SQL accordingly.
The main purpose of this is evaluating SPARQL queries against existing relational databases.
There exists previous work from many parties for rendering relational data as RDF and opening it to SPARQL access.
We can mention D2RQ, SPASQL, Squirrel RDF, DBLP and others.
The Virtuoso effort differs from these mainly in the following:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>Integration with a triple store.
Virtuoso can process a query for which some triple patterns will go to local or remote relational data and some to local physical RDF triples.

Database connectivity protocols are neutral to the syntax of queries they transmit, thus any SQL client, e.g. JDBC, ODBC or XMLA application, can send SPARQL queries and fetch result sets.

</listitem><listitem>Integration with SQL.

</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewrationale"><title>Rationale</title>
<para>
Since most of the data that is of likely use for the emerging semantic web is stored in relational databases, the argument for exposing this to SPARQL access is clear.
We note that historically, SQL access to relational data has essentially never been given to the public outside of the organization.
If programmatic access to corporate IS has been available to partners or the public, it has been through dynamic web pages or more recently web services.
There are reasons of performance, security, maintainability and so forth for this.
</para><para>
The culture of the emerging semantic web is however taking a different turn.
Since RDF and OWL offer a mergeable and queryable model for heterogeneous data, it is more meaningful and maintainable to expose selected data for outside query than it would be with SQL.
Advances in hardware make this also less of a performance issue than it would have been in the client-server database era.
</para><para>
In the context of Virtuoso, since Virtuoso is originally a virtual/federated database, incorporating SPARQL to relational mapping is an evident extension of the product's mission as a multi-protocol, multi-platform connector between information systems.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewquadmapatternsvalueandiriclasses"><title>Quad Map Patterns, Values and IRI Classes</title>
<para>
In the simplest sense, any relational schema can be rendered into RDF by converting all primary keys and foreign keys into IRI's, assigning a predicate IRI to each column, and an rdf:type predicate for each row linking it to a RDF class IRI corresponding to the table.
Then a triple with the primary key IRI as subject, the column IRI as predicate and the column's value as object is considered to exist for each column that is neither part of a primary or foreign key.
</para><para>
Strictly equating a subject value to a row and each column to a predicate is often good but is too restrictive for the general case.
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>Multiple triples with the same subject and predicate can exist.
</listitem><listitem>A single subject can get single-valued properties from multiple tables or in some cases stored procedures.
</listitem><listitem>An IRI value of a subject or other field of a triple can be composed from more than one SQL value, these values may reside in different columns, maybe in different joined tables.
</listitem><listitem>Some table rows should be excluded from mapping.
</listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>
Thus in the most common case the RDF meta schema should consist of independent transformations; the domain of each transformation is a result-set of some SQL <emphasis>SELECT</emphasis> statement and range is a set of triples.
The <emphasis>SELECT</emphasis> that produce the domain is quite simple: it does not use aggregate functions, joins and sorting, only inner joins and <emphasis>WHERE</emphasis> conditions.
There is no need to support outer joins in the RDF meta schema because NULLs are usually bad inputs for functions that produce IRIs.
In the rare cases when NULLs are OK for functions, outer joins can be encapsulated in SQL views.
The range of mapping can be described by a SPARQL triple pattern: a pattern field is a variable if it depends on table columns, otherwise it is a constant.
Values of variables in the pattern may have additional restrictions on datatypes, when datatypes of columns are known.
</para><para>
This common case of an RDF meta schema is implemented in Virtuoso, with one adjustment.
Virtuoso stores quads, not triples, using the graph field (G) to indicate that a triple belongs to some particular application or resource.
A SPARQL query may use quads from different graphs without large difference between G and the other three fields of a quad.
E.g., variable <emphasis>?g</emphasis> in expression <emphasis>GRAPH ?g {...}</emphasis> can be unbound.
SPARQL has special syntax for &quot;graph group patterns&quot; that is convenient for sets of triple patterns with a common graph, but it also has shorthands for common subject and predicate, so the difference is no more than in syntax.
There is only one feature that is specific for graphs but not for other fields: the SPARQL compiler can create restrictions on graphs according to <emphasis>FROM</emphasis> and <emphasis>FROM NAMED</emphasis> clauses.
</para><para>
Virtuoso Linked Data Views should offer the same flexibility with the graphs as SPARQL addressing physical triples.
A transformation cannot always be identified by the graph used for ranges because graph may be composed from SQL data. The key element of the meta schema is a &quot;<emphasis>quad map pattern</emphasis>&quot;.
A simple quad map pattern fully defines one particular transformation from one set of relational columns into triples that match one SPARQL graph pattern.
The main part of quad map pattern is four declarations of &quot;<emphasis>quad map values</emphasis>&quot;, each declaration specifies how to calculate the value of the corresponding triple field from the SQL data.
The pattern also lists boolean SQL expressions that should be used to filter out unwanted rows of source data (and to join multiple tables if source columns belong to different tables).
There are also quad map patterns that group together similar quad patterns but do not specify any real transformation or even prevent unwanted transformations from being used, they are described in &quot;Grouping Map Patterns&quot; below.
</para><para>
Quad map values refer to schema elements of two further types: &quot;IRI classes&quot; and &quot;literal classes&quot;.
</para>
<note><para>In SQL, adding a new view can not break anything. This is because SQL lacks the ability of querying &quot;everything&quot; so data sources are always specified. This is not true for SPARQL, so please treat <emphasis>any</emphasis> metadata manipulation as potentially destructive operation. If an RDF storage is supposed to be used by more than one application then these applications should be tested together, not one after other, and they should be installed/upgraded on live database in the very same order as they were installed/upgraded on instrumental machine during testing. Always remember that these applications share RDF tables so they may interfere.</para></note>
<sect3 id="rdfviewiriclasses"><title>IRI Classes</title>
<para>
An IRI class declares that a column or set of columns gets converted into a IRI in a certain way.
The conversion of this sort can be declared revertible (bijection) so an IRI can be parsed into original SQL values; this is useful when some equality of an IRI constant and a calculated IRI can be replaced with an equality of a parse result of a constant and an SQL column that is index criteria or simply faster.
In addition, the SPARQL optimizer will eliminate redundant conversions if one IRI class is explicitly declared as a subclass of another.
The most flexible declaration for conversion consists of specifying functions that assemble and disassemble from IRI into its constituent parts.
This is overkill for typical conversions so it is possible to specify only one sprintf-style format string such that <emphasis>sprintf()</emphasis> SQL function will print an IRI using this format and <emphasis>sprintf_inverse()</emphasis> will be able to parse it back.
</para><para>The use of <emphasis>sprintf_inverse()</emphasis> assumes that the format does not contain fragments like <emphasis>'%s%s'</emphasis> that make it impossible to separate parts of IRI from each other.
</para><para>
In the following, we shall map the Virtuoso users and user roles system tables into the SIOC ontology.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create iri class oplsioc:user_iri "http://myhost/sys/user?id=%d"
  (in uid integer not null) .
create iri class oplsioc:group_iri "http://myhost/sys/group?id=%d"
  (in gid integer not null) .

  (in super integer not null, in sub integer not null) .
create iri class oplsioc:dav_iri "http://myhost%s"
  (in path varchar) .
]]></programlisting>
<para>
These IRI classes are used for mapping data from the <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS</emphasis> and <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_ROLE_GRANTS</emphasis> system tables that are defined in Virtuoso as follows:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create table DB.DBA.SYS_USERS (
  U_ID                integer not null unique,
  U_NAME              char (128) not null primary key,
  U_IS_ROLE           integer default 0,
  U_FULL_NAME         char (128),
  U_E_MAIL            char (128) default &quot;,
  U_ACCOUNT_DISABLED  integer default 1,
  U_DAV_ENABLE        integer default 0,
  U_SQL_ENABLE        integer default 1,
  U_HOME              varchar (128),
. . .
 );
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Single record in <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS</emphasis> corresponds to a plain user or a group (role).
Users and roles are collectively named &quot;grantees&quot;. Thus a role may be granted to another role or to a user account.
A role grant may be direct (explicit) or assigned by recursion.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create table SYS_ROLE_GRANTS (
  GI_SUPER   integer,
  GI_SUB     integer,
  GI_DIRECT  integer default 1,

  primary key (GI_SUPER, GI_SUB, GI_DIRECT));
]]></programlisting>
<para>One IRI class usually corresponds to one ontology class, because similar things are usually called similarly.
One may wish to use identifiers of ontology classes as identifiers of related IRI classes, to not remember double number of names, e.g. <emphasis>create IRI class mybank:XpressXfer</emphasis> for subjects that will have <emphasis>rdf:type</emphasis> property <emphasis>mybank:XpressXfer</emphasis> made by mapping. That is technically possible but proven to become inconvenient and misleading as application evolves. While RDF types tend to persist, IRI classes may change over time or same subject may get more than one name via more than one IRI class, say, for exports to different systems. It is found to be more convenient to compose names of IRI classes by adding some common prefixes or suffixes to RDF classes (or to table names), say, write <emphasis>create IRI class mybank:XpressXfer_iri</emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfviewliteralclasses"><title>Literal Classes</title>
<para>
A &quot;literal class&quot; declares that a column or set of columns gets converted into a literal instead of an IRI.
More precisely, the result of conversion can be <emphasis>IRI_ID</emphasis> so it represents an IRI, but in current version of Virtuoso this is supported only for some internal built-in literal classes, not for classes declared by the user.
So for user-defined literal class the result of the conversion is an RDF literal even if it is a string representation of a valid IRI.
</para><para>
In any case, a literal class can be used only in quad map values of O fields, because Virtuoso does not support literal values as subjects.
</para><para>
A special case of literal class is the identity class that converts a value from <emphasis>varchar</emphasis> column into an untyped literal and value from column of any other SQL datatype into a typed literal with type from XMLSchema set, i.e. <emphasis>xsd:integer</emphasis>, <emphasis>xsd:dateTime</emphasis> and so on.
Columns of types <emphasis>ANY</emphasis> and <emphasis>IRI_ID</emphasis> are not supported.
</para><para>
The SPARQL optimizer knows that RDF literal types are pairwise disjoint so literal classes that produce literals of different types are known to be pairwise disjoint.
The optimizer will replace a join on two disjoint literal classes with an empty statement, to simplify the resulting query.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="rdfviewsimplequadmappatterns"><title>Simple Quad Map Patterns</title>

Declarations of IRI classes, literal classes and quad patterns are shared between all quad storages of an RDF meta schema but every quad storage contains only a subset of all available quad patterns.
Two quad storages are always defined:

Otherwise it removes the map from all storages.
There exists garbage collection for quad map patterns, so any unused map is immediately deleted.
A group is deleted with all its descendants.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewtranslationofpatterns"><title>Translation Of SPARQL Triple Patterns To Quad Map Patterns</title>
<para>
When a SPARQL query is compiled into SQL using a quad storage, every triple pattern should become a subquery that retrieves data from relational tables.
This subquery is an <emphasis>UNION ALL</emphasis> of joins generated from appropriate quad map patterns.
The complete SQL query is composed from these basic subqueries.
Thus the first operation of the SQL generation for a triple pattern is searching for quad map patterns that may in principle produce triples that match the triple pattern.
</para><para>
The more restrictions contained in the triple pattern the fewer quad map patterns will be used.
A triple pattern <emphasis>graph ?g { ?s ?p ?o }</emphasis> is common enough to invoke all data transformations of the storage.
A triple pattern <emphasis>graph &lt;g&gt; { ?s &lt;p&gt; &lt;o&gt; }</emphasis> will usually intersect with the range of only one quad map.
Sometimes it is possible to prove that the storage can not contain any data that matches the given triple pattern, hence zero number of members of <emphasis>UNION ALL</emphasis> will result in constantly empty result-set.
</para>
<para>The search for quad maps for a given pair of triple pattern and quad map storage is quite simple.
The storage is treated as a tree of map patterns where quad map patterns are leafs, grouping patterns are inner nodes and the whole storage is also treated as a grouping pattern that specify no fields and contains all top-level map patterns of the storage.
</para>
<para>
The tree is traversed from the root, left to right, non-leaf vertex are checked before their children.
The check of a vertex consists of up to four field checks, for G, S, P and O.
Every field check compares the field definition in the vertex and the corresponding field in the triple pattern, G and G, S and S and so on.
Note that a non-leaf vertex defines less than four of its fields, e.g., the root vertex does not define any of its fields and top-level <emphasis>graph map { ... }</emphasis> defines only graph.
Checks are performed only for defined fields and return one of three values: &quot;failed&quot;, &quot;passed&quot;, &quot;full match&quot;, according to the following rules:
</para>
<table><title>Matching Triple Field and Vertex Field</title>
<tgroup cols="3">
<thead><row>
<entry>Field of vertex</entry><entry>Field in triple pattern</entry><entry>Result</entry>
</row></thead>
<tbody>

<row><entry>constant</entry><entry>different constant</entry><entry>failed</entry></row>

<row><entry>quad map value of type X</entry><entry>variable, type does not intersect with X</entry><entry>failed</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>
<para>
If any of the checks fails, the vertex and all its children are excluded from the rest of processing.
Otherwise, if all four fields are defined for the quad map pattern, the map is added to the list of matching map patterns.
The difference between &quot;passed&quot; and &quot;full match&quot; is significant only if the map is declared with <emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis>
If all performed checks return &quot;full match&quot; and <emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis> is set then the traverse of the tree is stopped as soon as all children of the vertex are traversed.
The most typical use of this option is when the application developer is sure that all triples of a graph belong to his application and they come from his own quad map patterns, not from <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis>.
This is to prevent the SPARQL compiler from generating redundant subqueries accessing <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis>.
The declaration may look like
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create quad storage <mystorage>
  {
    graph <mygraph> option (exclusive) { . . . }
    create virtrdf:DefaultQuadMap
      using storage virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage .
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Exclusive patterns make the order of declarations important, because an exclusive declaration may &quot;throw a shadow&quot; on declarations after it.
Consider a database that have a special table RDF_TYPE that caches all RDF types of all subjects in all graphs.
Consider two declarations: all triples from graph <emphasis>&lt;http://myhost/sys&gt;</emphasis> and all triples with <emphasis>rdf:type</emphasis> predicate, both exclusive:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
graph <http://myhost/sys> option (exclusive)
  {
    . . . # mapping of DB.DBA.SYS_USERS as in previous examples.
  }
graph rdfdf:default-iid-nonblank (DB.DBA.RDF_TYPE.G)
subject rdfdf:default-iid (DB.DBA.RDF_TYPE.S)
predicate rdf:type
object rdfdf:default (DB.DBA.RDF_TYPE.O)
option (exclusive)
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The order of these declarations dictates that triple pattern
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
graph <http://myhost/sys> {?s rdf:type ?o}
]]></programlisting>
<para>
is compiled using only quad map patterns of the graph declaration, ignoring second declaration (and of course ignoring default mapping rule, if any).
An explicit <emphasis>option (order N)</emphasis> at the end of quad map pattern will tweak the priority.
By default, order will grow from 1000 for the first declaration in the statement to 1999 for the last, explicit configuration is especially useful to make order persistent to <emphasis>alter storage</emphasis> statements.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis> trick is ugly, low-level and prone to cause compilation errors after altering storage declarations.
When misused, it is as bad as &quot;red cut&quot; in PROLOG, but one must use this trick to build scalable storages.
</para>
<para>The <emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis> helps the SPARQL compiler to prepare better SQL queries, but sometimes it is &quot;too exclusive&quot;. For instance, if a grouping quad map pattern specify only quad map value for graph and no other fields then making it exclusive prohibits the use of all declarations of the storage after that one. Sometimes it is better to notify compiler that quads made by the given quad map pattern are supposed to be different from all quads made by declarations listed after the given one.</para>

<para>Consider an application that exports users&apos; personal data
as graphs whose IRIs looks like
<emphasis>http://www.example.com/DAV/home/</emphasis>username<emphasis>/RDF/personal/</emphasis>;
the application makes a query and a triple pattern is proven to be
restrictive enough to filter out all quads that are not similar to
quads generated by the given quad map pattern (say, the graph is
constant
<emphasis>http://www.example.com/DAV/home/JohnSmith/RDF/personal/</emphasis>). The
application do not hope to find any quads that match the pattern but
made by other applications, because graphs named like in the pattern
are supposed to be solely for this single purpose; if, say,
DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD occasionally contains some quads with graph equal to
<emphasis>http://www.example.com/DAV/home/JohnSmith/RDF/personal/</emphasis>
then they can be ignored.</para>

<para>Under this circumstances, the quad map pattern may have <emphasis>option (soft exclusive)</emphasis>. That grants a permission to the compiler to ignore rest of storage as soon as it is proven that the triple pattern can not access quads that does not match the pattern. So if that is proven then the pattern is exclusive and it makes the query faster; when unsure, the compiler work like there is no option at all.</para>


<note><para>The <emphasis>option (exclusive)</emphasis> can be used as
a security measure, <emphasis>option (soft exclusive)</emphasis> can
not. Say, if an financial application exports its data as a single
graph <emphasis>http://www.example.com/front-office/cash/</emphasis>
using <emphasis>exclusive</emphasis> then the query that explicitly
refers to that graph will never access any quads written by the
attacker into DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD using same graph IRI. The use of
<emphasis>soft exclusive</emphasis> gives no such protection. From the
compiler's perspective, the <emphasis>option (soft
exclusive)</emphasis> is a hint that may be ignored, not an
unambiguous order.</para></note>

<para>
There is one exception from the rules described above.
This exception is for <emphasis>virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage</emphasis> only.
If a graph variable of a quad map pattern is not bound and no source graph specified by <emphasis>FROM</emphasis> clauses then quad maps for specific constant graphs are ignored.
In other words, if a default quad storage contains quad maps for specific graphs then the query in that storage should explicitly specify the graph in order to use a map for graph.
This rule will not work if the default quad map is removed from the <emphasis>virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage</emphasis>.
This rule relates to the default storage itself, not to the containing patterns; copying some or all patterns into other storage will not reproduce there this special effect.
</para>
<para>So for example the query from below returns results when graph is specified i.e. 
when no graph is referenced, then run over physical store only is performed:</para>

<sect2 id="rdfviewdescribingsourcerelationaltables"><title>Describing Source Relational Tables</title>
<para>Quad map patterns of an application usually share a common set of source tables and quad map values of one pattern usually share either a single table or very small number of joined tables.
Join and filtering conditions are also usually repeated in different patterns.
It is not necessary to type table descriptions multiple times, they are declare once in the beginning of storage declaration statement and shared between all quad map declarations inside the statement.
Names of aliases can be used instead of table names in quad map values.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS as user WHERE (^{user.}^.U_IS_ROLE = 0)
FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS as group WHERE (^{group.}^.U_IS_ROLE = 1)
FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS as account
FROM user as active_user
  WHERE (^{active_user.}^.U_ACCOUNT_DISABLED = 0)
FROM DB.DBA.SYS_ROLE_GRANTS as grant
  WHERE (^{grant.}^.GI_SUPER = ^{account.}^.U_ID)
  WHERE (^{grant.}^.GI_SUB = ^{group.}^.U_ID)
  WHERE (^{grant.}^.GI_SUPER = ^{user.}^.U_ID)
]]></programlisting>
<para>
This declares five distinct aliases for two distinct tables, and six filtering conditions.
Every condition is an SQL expression with placeholders where a reference to the table should be printed.
The SPARQL compiler will not try to parse texts of these expressions (except dummy search for placeholders), so any logical expressions are acceptable.
When a quad map pattern declaration refers to some aliases, the <emphasis>WHERE</emphasis> clause of the generated SQL code will contain a conjunction of all distinct texts of &quot;relevant&quot; conditions.
A condition is relevant if every alias inside the condition is used in some quad map value of the map pattern, either directly or via clause like <emphasis>from user as active_user</emphasis>.
(<emphasis>user</emphasis> is a &quot;<emphasis>base alias</emphasis>&quot; for <emphasis>active_user</emphasis>).
</para><para>
Consider a group of four declarations.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
graph <http://myhost/sys>
  {
    oplsioc:user_iri (active_user.U_ID)
        a oplsioc:active-user .
    oplsioc:membership_iri (grant.GI_SUPER, grant.GI_SUB).
        oplsioc:is_direct
            grant.GI_DIRECT ;
        oplsioc:member-e-mail
            active_user.U_E_MAIL
               where (^{active_user.}^.U_E_MAIL like 'mailto:%').
    ldap:account-ref (account.U_NAME)
        ldap:belongs-to
            ldap:account-ref (group.U_NAME) option (using grant).
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The first declaration will extend <emphasis>&lt;http://myhost/sys&gt;</emphasis> graph with one imaginary triples <emphasis>{ user a oplsioc:active-user }</emphasis> for every account record that is not a role and not disabled.
The second declaration deals with membership records.
A membership is a pair of a grantee (&quot;super&quot;) and a granted role (&quot;sub&quot;) stored as a row in <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_ROLE_GRANTS</emphasis>).
</para><para>
The second declaration states that every membership has <emphasis>oplsioc:is_direct</emphasis> property with value from <emphasis>GI_DIRECT</emphasis> column of that table (roles may be granted to other roles and users, so permissions are &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;recursive&quot;).
</para><para>
The third declaration declares <emphasis>oplsioc:member-e-mail</emphasis> property of memberships.
The value is a literal string from <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS.U_E_MAIL</emphasis>, if the grantee is active (not disabled) and is not a role and its e-mail address starts with <emphasis>'mailto:'</emphasis>.
The join between <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_ROLE_GRANTS</emphasis> and <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS</emphasis> is made by equality <emphasis>(GI_SUPER = U_ID)</emphasis> because the alias <emphasis>active_user</emphasis> in the declaration &quot;inherits&quot; all conditions specified for <emphasis>user</emphasis>.
In addition, the SPARQL compiler will add one more condition to check if the <emphasis>U_E_MAIL</emphasis> is not null because the NULL value is not a valid object and it knows that <emphasis>U_E_MAIL</emphasis> is not declared as <emphasis>NOT NULL</emphasis>.
</para><para>
The last declaration contains an <emphasis>option</emphasis> clause.
As usual, this indicates that the basic functionality is good for many tasks but not for all.
In this declaration, the <emphasis>ldap:belongs-to</emphasis> property establishes a relation between grantee (subject) and a granted role (object).
Both subject and object IRIs are based on account name, <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS.U_NAME</emphasis>, so the quad map pattern contains two references to different aliases of <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS</emphasis> but no alias for <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_ROLE_GRANTS</emphasis>.
Hence the declaration could produce a triple for every row of the Cartesian product of the <emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_USERS</emphasis>.
To fix the problem, <emphasis>option (using alias-name)</emphasis> tells the compiler to process the alias-name as if it's used in some quad map value of the pattern.
</para><para>
It is an error to use an alias only in <emphasis>where</emphasis> clause of the quad map pattern but neither in values or in <emphasis>option (using alias-name)</emphasis>.
To detect more typos, an alias used in quad map values can not appear in <emphasis>option (using alias-name)</emphasis> clause.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewiriusingfunction"><title>Function-Based IRI Classes</title>
<para>Most of IRI classes can be declared by a sprintf format string, but sophisticated cases may require calculations, not only printing the string. <emphasis>create IRI class using function</emphasis> allows the application transform relational values to IRIs by any custom routines.</para>
<para>
Let us extend the previous example about users and groups by a new class for grantees. Both users and groups are grantees and we have defined two IRI classes for them. Classes <emphasis>oplsioc:user_iri</emphasis> and <emphasis>oplsioc:group_iri</emphasis> work fine for quad maps of <emphasis>U_ID</emphasis> if and only if the value of <emphasis>U_IS_ROLE</emphasis> is accordingly restricted to FALSE or TRUE, otherwise one may occasionally generate, say, user IRI for a group.
To create and parse IRIs that correspond to any U_IDs, two functions should be created:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI (in id integer)
returns varchar
{
  declare isrole integer;
  isrole := coalesce ((SELECT top 1 U_IS_ROLE
      FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS WHERE U_ID = id ) );
  if (isrole is null)
    return NULL;
  else if (isrole)
    return sprintf ('http://%s/sys/group?id=%d', id);
  else
    return sprintf ('http://%s/sys/user?id=%d', id);
};
]]></programlisting>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI_INVERSE (in id_iri varchar)
returns integer
{
  declare parts any;
  parts := sprintf_inverse (id_iri,
      'http://myhost/sys/user?id=%d', 1 );
  if (parts is not null)
    {
      if (exists (SELECT top 1 1 FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS
          WHERE U_ID = parts[0] and not U_IS_ROLE ) )
        return parts[0];
    }
  parts := sprintf_inverse (id_iri,
      'http://myhost/sys/group?id=%d', 1 );
  if (parts is not null)
    {
      if (exists (SELECT top 1 1 FROM DB.DBA.SYS_USERS
          WHERE U_ID = parts[0] and U_IS_ROLE ) )
        return parts[0];
   }
  return NULL;
  };
]]></programlisting>
<para>These functions may be more useful if the SPARQL web service endpoint is allowed to use them:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
grant execute on DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI to "SPARQL";
grant execute on DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI_INVERSE to "SPARQL";
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The next declaration creates an IRI class based on these two functions:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create iri class oplsioc:grantee_iri using
  function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI (in id integer)
    returns varchar,
  function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI_INVERSE (in id_iri varchar)
    returns integer .
]]></programlisting>
<para>
In common case, IRI class declaration contains an N-array function that composes IRIs and N inverse functions that gets an IRI as an argument and extracts the Nth SQL value.
IRI composing function should silently return NULL on incorrect arguments instead of error signal.
Inverse functions should return NULL if the argument has an incorrect type or value.
</para>
<para>
It is possible to specify only composing function without any of inverse functions. However <emphasis>option (bijection)</emphasis> can not be used in that case, obviously.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfconnvarsiniriclasses"><title>Connection Variables in IRI Classes</title>
<para>Writing function-based IRI class is overkill when the IRI can in principle be made by a <link linkend="fn_sprintf_iri"><function>sprintf_iri</function></link> but the format should contain some context-specific data, such as host name used for the <link linked="rdfdynamiclocal">dynamic renaming of local IRIs</link>.
Format strings offer a special syntax for that cases.
<emphasis>%{varname}U</emphasis> acts as <emphasis>%U</emphasis> but the function <link linkend="fn_sprintf"><function>sprintf</function></link> will take the value from client connection variable <emphasis>varname</emphasis>, not from list of arguments.
Similarly, <link linkend="fn_sprintf_inverse"><function>sprintf_inverse</function></link> will not return fragment that match to <emphasis>%{varname}U</emphasis> in the vector of other fragments; instead it will get the value from connection environment and ensure that it matches the fragment of input; mismatch between printed and actual value of variable will means that the whole string do not match the format.</para>
<para>SPARQL optimizer knows about this formatting feature and sometimes it makes more deductions from occurrence of <emphasis>%{varname}U</emphasis> than from occurrence of plain <emphasis>%U</emphasis>, so this notation may be used in <emphasis>option ( returns ...)</emphasis> when appropriate.
Of course, the optimizer has no access to the actual value of connection variable because it may vary from run to run or may change between the compilation and the run, but the value is supposed to be persistent during any single query run so <emphasis>%{myvariable}U</emphasis> in one place is equal to <emphasis>%{myvariable}U</emphasis> in other.</para>
<para>Connection variables are set by <link linkend="fn_connection_set"><function>connection_set</function></link> and some of them have default values that are used if not overridden by application:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem><emphasis>URIQADefaultHost</emphasis> is for default host as it is specified in Virtuoso configuration file.
Note, however, that it will be escaped when printed so if it contains colon and port number then the colon is escaped.
In addition, there are special variables that match dynamic renaming of local IRIs more accurately.</listitem>
<listitem><emphasis>WSHost</emphasis> is for host and port as it is used by current client connection for dynamic renaming.
The colon before port will be escaped.</listitem>
<listitem><emphasis>WSHostName</emphasis> is for host name only, without port, as it is used by current client connection for dynamic renaming.</listitem>
<listitem><emphasis>WSHostPort</emphasis> is for port part of host IRI. That is string, not integer. The only real use of the variable is in formats like <emphasis>http://%{WSHostName}U:%{WSHostPort}U/...</emphasis>.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>It is inconvenient to write different format strings for
different cases. Two most common policies are different host names
for default HTTP port of a publicly available service and different
non-default ports for one or more host names of an intranet
installation; these two approaches are almost never used in a mix. So
declaration of IRI classes may use shorthand
<emphasis>^{DynamicLocalFormat}^</emphasis> in format strings that is
expanded either to <emphasis>http://%{WSHost}U</emphasis> or to
<emphasis>http://%{WSHostName}U:%{WSHostPort}U/...</emphasis>,
depending on absence or presence of port number in the value of
<emphasis>DefaultHost</emphasis> parameter of
<emphasis>URIQA</emphasis> section of configuration file.</para>
<note><para><emphasis>^{DynamicLocalFormat}^</emphasis> is for IRI class declarations only and is not expanded in any other place, so it is useful sometimes to create an IRI class with empty argument list in order to get &quot;almost constant&quot; IRIs calculated without writing special procedures.</para></note>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewbijandreturns"><title>Lookup Optimization -- BIJECTION and RETURNS Options</title>
<para>
There is one subtle problem with IRI class declarations.
To get benefit from a relational index, SPARQL optimizer should compose equality between table column and some known SQL value, not between return value of IRI class and a known composed IRI.
In addition, redundant calculations of IRIs takes time.
To enable this optimization, an IRI class declaration should end with <emphasis>option (bijection)</emphasis> clause. For some simple format strings the compiler may recognize the bijection automatically but an explicit declaration is always a good idea.
</para>
<note><title>Note:</title>
<para>
See also: <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence">Wikipedia - Bijection</ulink>.
In mathematics, a bijection, or a bijective function is a function f from a set X to a set Y such that,
for every y in Y, there is exactly one x in X such that f(x) = y.
</para>
<para>
Alternatively, f is bijective if it is a one-to-one correspondence between those sets; i.e.,
both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).
</para>
</note>
<para>
The SPARQL compiler may produce big amounts of SQL code when the query contains equality of two calculated IRIs and these IRIs may come from many different IRI classes.
It is possible to provide hints that will let the compiler check if two IRI classes form disjoint sets of possible IRI values. The more disjoint sets are found the less possible combinations remain so the resulting SQL query will contain fewer unions of joins.
The SPARQL compiler can prove some properties of sprintf format strings. E.g., it can prove that set of all strings printed by &quot;http://example.com/item%d&quot; and the set of strings printed by &quot;http://example.com/item%d/&quot; are disjoint.
It can prove some more complicated statements about unions and intersections of sets of strings.
The IRI or literal class declaration may contain <emphasis>option (returns ...)</emphasis> clause that will specify one or more sprintf patterns that cover the set of generated values.
Consider a better version of IRI class declaration listed above:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create iri class oplsioc:grantee_iri using
  function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI (in id integer)
    returns varchar,
  function DB.DBA.GRANTEE_URI_INVERSE (in id_iri varchar)
    returns integer
  option ( bijection,
    returns "http://myhost/sys/group?id=%d"
    union   "http://myhost/sys/user?id=%d" ) .
]]></programlisting>
<para>
It is very important to keep IRI classes easily distinguishable by the text of IRI string and easy to parse.
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>Format <emphasis>%U</emphasis> is better than <emphasis>%s</emphasis>, especially in the middle of IRI, because the <emphasis>%U</emphasis> fragment can not contain characters like &quot;/&quot; or &quot;=&quot;; one may prove that <emphasis>/%U/</emphasis> and <emphasis>/abra%d/cadabra/</emphasis> are disjoint but <emphasis>/%s/</emphasis> and <emphasis>/abra%d/cadabra/</emphasis> are not disjoint.

</listitem><listitem>End-of-line is treated as a special character, so placing <emphasis>%U</emphasis> or <emphasis>%d</emphasis> between &quot;/&quot; and end of line is as good as placing it between two &quot;/&quot;.
</listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>
In some cases <emphasis>option (returns ...)</emphasis> can be used for IRI classes that are declared using sprintf format, but actual data have more specific format.
Consider a literal class declaration that is used to output strings and the application knows that all these strings are ISBN numbers:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create literal class example:isbn_ref "%s" (in isbn varchar not null)
  option ( bijection, returns "%u-%u-%u-%u" union "%u-%u-%u-X" )
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Sometimes interoperability restrictions will force you to violate these rules but please try to follow them as often as possible.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfviewsubclasses"><title>Join Optimization -- Declaring IRI Subclasses</title>
<para>
Additional problem appears when the equality is between two IRIs of two different IRI classes.
Even if both of them are bijections, the compiler does not know if these IRI classes behave identically on the intersection of their domains.
To let the optimizer know this fact, one IRI class can be explicitly declared as a subclass of another:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
make oplsioc:user_iri subclass of oplsioc:grantee_iri .
make oplsioc:group_iri subclass of oplsioc:grantee_iri .
]]></programlisting>
<para>
The SPARQL compiler can not check the validity of a subclass declaration.
The developer should carefully test functions to ensure that transformations are really subclasses, as well as to ensure that functions of an IRI class declarations are really inverse to each other.
</para><para>
When declaring that a table's primary key is converted into a IRI according to one IRI class, one usually declares that all foreign keys referring to this class also get converted into an IRI as per this same class, or subclass of same class.
</para><para>
Subclasses can be declared for literal classes as well as for IRI classes, but this case is rare. The reason is that most of literals are made by identity literal classes that are disjoint to each other even if values may be equal in SQL sense, such as <emphasis>"2"</emphasis> of type <emphasis>xsd:integer</emphasis> and <emphasis>"2.0"</emphasis> of type <emphasis>xsd:double</emphasis>.

<sect2 id="rdfmetadatarecovery"><title>RDF Metadata Maintenance and Recovery</title>
   <para>
This section refers to checking and backing up Linked Data View and storage declarations only. The checks and backup/restore do not affect physical quads, relational schema or tables or data therein. For general backup and restore, see server administration.
     To detect and fix automatically most popular sorts of RDF metadata corruption use <link linkend="fn_rdf_audit_metadata"><function>DB.DBA.RDF_AUDIT_METADATA</function></link>.
It is also possible to backup RDF data by
    <link linkend="fn_rdf_backup_metadata"><function>DB.DBA.RDF_BACKUP_METADATA</function></link>
and restore the saved state later by using
    <link linkend="fn_rdf_restore_metadata"><function>DB.DBA.RDF_RESTORE_METADATA</function></link>.
It is convenient to make a backup before any modification of quad storages, quad map patterns or IRI classes, especially during debugging new Linked Data Views.
   </para>
<note><para>In SQL, adding a new view can not break anything. This is because SQL lacks the ability of querying &quot;everything&quot; so data sources are always specified. This is not true for SPARQL, so please treat <emphasis>any</emphasis> metadata manipulation as potentially destructive operation. If an RDF storage is supposed to be used by more than one application then these applications should be tested together, not one after other, and they should be installed/upgraded on live database in the very same order as they were installed/upgraded on instrumental machine during testing. Always remember that these applications share RDF tables so they may interfere.</para></note>

<sect2 id="splitrdfview"><title>Split Linked Data View</title>
<para>Linked Data View can be created by two or more "sparql alter storage" statements. In each statement
can be created one quad map that contains mappings for half or a third of all tables. Quad maps
created should have distinct names but may mention same graph. The important fact is that if the
Linked Data View in question is exclusive for a graph then only the last quad map should be exclusive but
all previous should not have this option. This is because if a map is exclusive on a graph the rest
of maps on that graph will be silently ignored.</para>

<sect1 id="rdfrdfviewgnr"><title>Automated Generation of Linked Data Views over Relational Data Sources</title>
<sect2 id="rdfrdfviewgnrintro"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Virtuoso offers from Conductor UI an HTML based Wizard interface for dynamically generating &amp;
publishing RDF based Linked Data from ODBC or JDBC accessible relational data sources. Basically,
a mechanism for building RDF based Linked Data views over relational data sources.
</para>
<para>The proliferation of relational databases across enterprises and behind Web sites, makes them a
vital data source for the burgeoning Linked Data Web. Thus, the process of publishing Linked Data from
these sources needs to be as unobtrusive as possible. Naturally, a balance has to be struck between
unobtrusive generation of Linked Data and traditional relational database management system (RDBMS)
virtues such as:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Scalability</listitem>
  <listitem>Security</listitem>
  <listitem>Analytical Expressivity of SQL</listitem>
  <listitem>Separation of Data Access and Data Storage via ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET CLIs.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The following steps must be taken to publish RDF-based Linked Data:
</para>
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>Identifying ODBC or JDBC data sources that host the data you seek to publish
(assuming the data isn't Virtuoso RDBMS hosted -- in which case, skip ahead to step #3).</listitem>
  <listitem>Attach/Link TABLEs or VIEWs from the external data sources into Virtuoso via their Data Source Names (DSNs).</listitem>
  <listitem>Identify the internal or external TABLEs or VIEWs that hold the data you wish to publish.</listitem>
  <listitem>Configure Endpoints and Re-write Rules to disambiguate data object (resource) identity and description through HTTP-based content negotiation.</listitem>
  <listitem>Expose the Data Source Ontology and associated Instance Data in Linked Data form through those Endpoints and Re-write Rules.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
These steps may be largely automated (the "One-Click" Deployment below), or performed manually ("Using the Conductor's HTML-based Wizard" further down).
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfrdfviewgnroneclick"><title>One Click Linked Data Generation &amp; Deployment</title>
<para>The following steps provide a one-click guide for publishing ODBC- or JDBC-accessible RDBMS data in RDF Linked Data form, using the "Generate &amp; Publish" Conductor feature.

<sect1 id="virtuososponger"><title>RDFizer Middleware (Sponger)</title>
    <sect2 id="virtuosospongerintro"><title>What Is The Sponger?</title>
<para>The Virtuoso Sponger is the Linked Data middleware component of Virtuoso that generates 
	Linked Data from a variety of data sources, supporting a wide variety of data representation 
	and serialization formats. The sponger is transparently integrated into Virtuoso's SPARQL Query 
	Processor where it delivers URI de-referencing within SPARQL query patterns, across disparate 
	data spaces. It also delivers configurable smart HTTP caching services. Optionally, it can be 
	used by the <link linkend="contentcrawlerrdf">Virtuoso Content Crawler</link> to periodically 
	populate and replenish data within the native RDF Quad Store. 
</para>
<para>The sponger is a fully fledged HTTP proxy service that is also directly accessible via 
	SOAP or REST interfaces.
</para>
<para>As depicted below, OpenLink's broad portfolio of Linked-Data-aware products supports a number 
	of routes for creating or consuming Linked Data. The Sponger provides a key platform for developers 
	to generate quality data meshes from unstructured or semi-structured data sources.
</para>
<figure id="virtuosospongerdiagram" float="1">
		<title>OpenLink Linked Data generation options</title>
		<graphic fileref="linked_data_gen_opts3.png"/>
        </figure>
<para>
Architecturally, the Sponger is comprised of a number of Cartridges two types of cartridges: Extractor 
and Meta Cartridges. Extractor Cartridges focus on data extraction and transformation services while 
the Meta Cartridges provide lookups and joins across other linked data spaces and Web 2.0 APIs. Both 
cartridge types are themselves comprised of a data extractors and RDF Schema/Ontology Mapper 
components.</para>
<para>Cartridges are is highly customizable. Custom cartridges can be developed using any language 
	supported by the Virtuoso Server Extensions API enabling structured linked data generation from 
	resource types not available in the default Sponger Cartridge collection bundled -- as part of 
	the Virtuoso Sponger VAD package (rdf_mappers_dav.vad).

	<sect2 id="virtuosospongerimp"><title>Why is it Important?</title>
<para>	
A majority of the worlds data naturally resides in non RDF form at the current time. The Sponger
delivers middleware that accelerates the bootstrap of the Semantic Data Web by generating RDF
from non RDF data sources, unobtrusively. This "Swiss army knife" for on-the-fly Linked Data generation 
provides a bridge between the traditional Document Web and the Linked Data Web ("Data Web").
</para>
<para>Sponging data from non-RDF Web sources and converting it to RDF exposes the data in a 
canonical form for querying and inference, and enables fast and easy construction of linked 
data driven mesh-ups as opposed to code driven Web 2.0 mash-ups.
</para>
<para>The RDF extraction and instance data generation products that offer functionality 
demonstrated by the Sponger are also commonly referred to as RDFizers.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="virtuosospongerworkpr"><title>How Does It Work?</title>
<para>
When an RDF aware client requests data from a network accessible resource via the Sponger
the following events occur:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>A requests in made for data in RDF form, and if RDF is returned nothing further happens</listitem>
<listitem>If RDF isn't returned, then the Sponger passes the data through a Metadata Extraction
Pipeline process (using Metadata Extractors)</listitem>
<listitem>The extracted data is transformed to RDF via a Mapping Pipeline process (RDF is extracted by way
of Ontology matching and mapping) that results in RDF Entities (instance data) generation</listitem>
<listitem>RDF Entities are returned to the client</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The imported data forms a local cache and its invalidation rules conform to those of traditional
HTTP clients (Web Browsers). Thus, expiration time is determined based on subsequent data fetches of
the same resource (note: the first data load will record the 'expires' header) with current time
compared to expiration time stored in the local cache. If HTTP 'expires' header data isn't returned
by the source data server, then the "Sponger" will derive it's own invalidation time frame by
evaluating the 'date' header and 'last-modified' HTTP headers. Irrespective of path taken,
local cache invalidation is driven by an assessment of current time relative to recorded expiration time.
</para>
<para>To manage the cache expiration, set the <emphasis>MinExpiration</emphasis> parameter in 
your Virtuoso.ini file.</para>
<para>Read full description of the parameter in the <link linkend="ini_SPARQL">[SPARQL] ini seciton</link>.</para>
<para>Designed with a pluggable architecture, the Sponger's core functionality is provided by Cartridges.
Each cartridge includes Data Extractors which extract data from one or more data sources, and Ontology
Mappers which map the extracted data to one or more ontologies/schemas, and route to producing RDF
Linked Data.
</para>
<para>The Schema Mappers are typically XSLT (e.g. GRDDL and other OpenLink Mapping Schemas) or
Virtuoso PL based. The Metadata Extractors may be developed in Virtuoso PL, C/C++, Java, or any
other language that can be integrated into the Virtuoso via it's server extensions APIs.
</para>
<para>
The Sponger also includes a pluggable name resolution mechanism that enables the development of
Custom Resolvers for naming schemes (e.g. URNs) associated with protocols beyond HTTP.
Examples of custom resolvers include:

    <sect3 id="virtuosospongerusageprocessor"><title>SPARQL Query Processor IRI Dereferencing</title>
    <para>The Sponger is transparently integrated into the Virtuoso SPARQL query processor, where it supports
IRI dereferencing.
      </para>
      <para>Virtuoso extends the SPARQL Query Language such that it is possible to download RDF resources 
      	from a given IRI, parse, and then store the resulting triples in a graph, with all three operations 
      	performed during the SPARQL query-execution process. The IRI/URI of the graph used to store the 
      	triples is usually equal to the URL where the resources are downloaded from, consequently the 
      	feature is known as "IRI/URI dereferencing". If a SPARQL query instructs the SPARQL processor 
      	to retrieve the target graph into local storage, then the SPARQL sponger will be invoked.
      </para>
      <para>The SPARQL extensions for IRI dereferencing are described below. Essentially these enable 
      	downloading and local storage of selected triples either from one or more named graphs, or 
      	based on a proximity search from a starting URI for entities matching the select criteria and 
      	also related by the specified predicates, up to a given depth. For full details see 
      	section <link linkend="rdfiridereferencing">Linked Data - IRI Dereferencing</link>.
      </para>
      <para>Note: For brevity, any reference to URI/IRIs above or in subsequent sections implies 
      an HTTP URI/IRI, where IRI is an internationalized URI. Similarly, in the context of the 
      Sponger, the term IRI in the Virtuoso reference documentation should be taken to mean an HTTP IRI.	
      </para> 
      <sect4 id="virtuosospongerusageprocessor"><title>SPARQL Extensions for IRI Dereferencing of FROM Clauses</title>
        <para>In addition to the "define get:..." SPARQL extensions for IRI dereferencing in FROM 
        	clauses, Virtuoso supports dereferencing SPARQL IRIs used in the WHERE clause (graph patterns) 
        	of a SPARQL query via a set of "define input:grab-..." pragmas.
        </para>	
        <para>Consider an RDF resource which describes a member of a contact list, user1, and also 
        	contains statements about other users, user2 anduser3 , known to him. Resource user3 in turn 
        	contains statements about user4 and so on. If all the data relating to these users were 
        	loaded into Virtuoso's RDF database, the query to retrieve the details of all the users 
        	could be quite simple. e.g.:         	
        </para>

        <para>But what if some or all of these resources were not present in Virtuoso's quad store? 
        	The highly distributed nature of the Linked Data Web makes it highly likely that these 
        	interlinked resources would be spread across several data spaces. Virtuoso's 'input:grab-...' 
        	extensions to SPARQL enable IRI dereferencing in such a way that all appropriate Network resources 
        	are loaded, i.e. "being fetched", during query execution, even if some of the Network resources are not 
        	known beforehand. For any particular resource matched, and if necessary downloaded, by the 
        	query, it is possible to download related resources via a designated predicate path(s) to 
        	a specifiable depth i.e. number of 'hops', distance, or degrees of separation (i.e compute 
        	Transitive Closures in SPARQL).

    <para>The Sponger's functionality is also exposed via an in-built REST style Web service. This web
service takes a target URL and either returns the content "as is" or tries to transform (by sponging)

    <para>When the rdf_mappers package is installed, Virtuoso reserves the path '/about/[id|data|rdf|html]/http/' for
Sponger Proxy URI Service. For example, if a Virtuoso installation on host example.com listens for HTTP
requests on port 8080 then client applications should use a 'service endpoint' string equal to
'http://example.com:8080/about/[id|data|rdf|html]/http/'. If the rdf_mappers package is not installed, then
the service uses the path '/proxy/rdf/'.</para>

        <para>As the Sponger and ODS-Briefcase both extract structured data, what is the relationship 
        	between these two facilities?
        </para>	
        <para>The principal difference between the two is that the Sponger is anRDF data crawler &amp; 
        	generator, whereas Briefcase's structured data extractor is a WebDAV resourcefilter. The 
        	Briefcase structured data extractor is aimed at providing RDF data from WebDAV resources. 
        	Thus, if none of the available Sponger cartridges are able to extract metadata and produce 
        	RDF structured data, the Sponger calls upon the Briefcase extractor as the last resort in 
        	the RDF structured data generation pipeline.

<sect2 id="virtuosospongerconsm"><title>Consuming the Generated RDF Structured Data</title>
  <para>The generated RDF-based structured data (RDF) can be consumed in a number of ways, depending on 
  	whether or not the data is persisted in Virtuoso's RDF Quad Store.
  </para>
  <para>If the data is persisted, it can be queried through the Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint associated with 
  	any Virtuoso instance: /sparql. The RDF is exposed in a graph typically identified using a URL matching 
  	the source resource URL from which the RDF data was generated. Naturally, any SQL query can also access 
  	this, since SPARQL can be freely intermixed with SQL via Virtuoso's SPASQL (SPARQL inside SQL) 
  	functionality. RDF data is also accessible through Virtuoso's implementation of the URIQA protocol.
  </para>
  <para>If not persisted, as is the case with the RDF Proxy Service, the data can be consumed by an RDF 
  	aware Web client, e.g. an RDF browser such as the OpenLink Data Explorer (ODE).

<sect3 id="virtuosospongerrdfmappers"><title>SPARQL IRI Dereferencing</title>
<para>The Virtuoso SPARQL engine (called for brevity just SPARQL below) supports IRI Dereferencing,
however it understands only RDF data, that is it can retrieve only files containing RDF/XML, turtle
or N3 serialized RDF data, if format is unknown it will try mapping with built-in WebDAV metadata
extractor. In order to extend this feature with dereferencing web or file resources which naturally
don't have RDF data (like PDF, JPEG files for example) is provided a special mechanism in SPARQL
engine. This mechanism is called RDF mappers for translation of non-RDF data files to RDF.</para>
<para>In order to instruct the SPARQL to call a RDF mapper it needs to be registered and it will
be called for a given URL or MIME type pattern. In other words, when unknown for SPARQL format is
received during URL dereferencing process, it will look into a special registry (a table) to match
either the MIME type or IRI using a regular expression, if match is found the mapper function will
be called.</para>
<sect4 id="virtuosospongerproxy"><title>Sponger Proxy service</title>
<para>Sponger functionality is also exposed via Virtuoso's "/proxy/rdf/" endpoint, as an in-built
REST style Web service available in any Virtuoso standard installation. This web service takes
a target URL and either returns the content "as is" or tries to transform (by sponging) to RDF.
Thus, the proxy service can be used as a 'pipe' for RDF browsers to browse non-RDF sources.

    <para>A Meta Cartridge submits a Resource to a third-party Web Service for processing. Returned RDF 
    	supplements the RDF generated by Extractor and other Meta Cartridges. Locally generated RDF may 
    	also be submitted to the third-party services, instead-of or in-addition-to the original 
    	Resource itself.
    </para>	
    <para>Default Sponger behavior is for all installed Meta Cartridges to be brought to bear on all

  will cause the Sponger to drop cache even if it is marked to be in the fly. Thus, if 
  network resource fetched cache by some reason is left in some inconsistent state like shutdown during the fetching, then 'clean' is required 
  as it doesn't check cache state. <emphasis>Note</emphasis>: must be used with caution as other threads 
  may be doing Network Resource Fetch at same time.</entry>

  <para>The Sponger forms part of the extensible RDF framework built into Virtuoso Universal Server. A
key component of the Sponger's pluggable architecture is its support for Sponger Cartridges, which
themselves are comprised of an Entity Extractor and an Ontology Mapper. Virtuoso bundles numerous
pre-written cartridges for RDF data extraction from a wide range of data sources. However, developers
are free to develop their own custom cartridges. This programmer's guide describes how.</para>
  <para>The guide is a companion to the <ulink url="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/Whitepapers/pdf/sponger_whitepaper_10102007.pdf">Virtuoso Sponger</ulink> whitepaper. The latter describes the Sponger in depth, its architecture, configuration, use and integration with other Virtuoso facilities such as the Open Data Services (ODS) application framework. This guide focuses solely on custom cartridge development.</para>

      <title>Cartridge Architecture</title>
      <para>The Sponger is comprised of cartridges which are themselves comprised of an entity extractor
and an ontology mapper. Entities extracted from non-RDF resources are used as the basis for generating
structured data by mapping them to a suitable ontology. A cartridge is invoked through its cartridge hook,
a Virtuoso/PL procedure entry point and binding to the cartridge's entity extractor and ontology mapper.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Entity Extractor</emphasis></para>
      <para>When an RDF aware client requests data from a network accessible resource via the Sponger the
following events occur:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>A request is made for data in RDF form (explicitly via HTTP Accept Headers), and if
RDF is returned nothing further happens. </listitem>
        <listitem>If RDF isn't returned, the Sponger passes the data through a <emphasis>Entity Extraction Pipeline</emphasis>
(using Entity Extractors). </listitem>
        <listitem>The extracted data is transformed into RDF via a <emphasis>Mapping Pipeline</emphasis>. RDF instance data is generated by way of ontology matching and mapping. </listitem>
        <listitem>RDF instance data (aka. RDF Structured Linked Data) are returned to the client.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para><emphasis>Extraction Pipeline</emphasis></para>
      <para>Depending on the file or format type detected at ingest, the Sponger applies the appropriate
entity extractor. Detection occurs at the time of content negotiation instigated by the retrieval user
agent. The normal extraction pipeline processing is as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>The Sponger tries to get RDF data (including N3 or Turtle) directly from the dereferenced
URL. If it finds some, it returns it, otherwise, it continues.</listitem>
        <listitem>If the URL refers to a HTML file, the Sponger tries to find "link" elements referring to
RDF documents. If it finds one or more of them, it adds their triples into a temporary RDF graph and
continues its processing.</listitem>
        <listitem>The Sponger then scans for microformats or GRDDL. If either is found, RDF triples are
generated and added to a temporary RDF graph before continuing.</listitem>
        <listitem>If the Sponger finds eRDF or RDFa data in the HTML file, it extracts it from the HTML
file and inserts it into the RDF graph before continuing.</listitem>
        <listitem>If the Sponger finds it is talking with a web service such as Google Base, it maps
the API of the web service with an ontology, creates triples from that mapping and includes the triples
into the temporary RDF graph.</listitem>
        <listitem>The next fallback is scanning of the HTML header for different Web 2.0 types or RSS
1.1, RSS 2.0, Atom, etc. </listitem>
        <listitem>Failing those tests, the scan then uses standard Web 1.0 rules to search in the
header tags for metadata (typically Dublin Core) and transform them to RDF and again add them to the
temporary graph. Other HTTP response header data may also be transformed to RDF.</listitem>
        <listitem>If nothing has been retrieved at this point, the ODS-Briefcase metadata
extractor is tried.</listitem>
        <listitem>Finally, if nothing is found, the Sponger will return an empty graph.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
      <para><emphasis>Ontology Mapper</emphasis></para>
      <para>Sponger ontology mappers peform the the task of generating RDF instance data from
extracted entities (non-RDF) using ontologies associated with a given data source type. They are
typically XSLT (using GRDDL or an in-built Virtuoso mapping scheme) or Virtuoso/PL based. Virtuoso
comes preconfigured with a large range of ontology mappers contained in one or more Sponger
cartridges.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Cartridge Registry</emphasis></para>
      <para>To be recognized by the SPARQL engine, a Sponger cartridge must be registered in
the Cartridge Registry by adding a record to the table DB.DBA.SYS_RDF_MAPPERS, either manually
via DML, or more easily through Conductor, Virtuoso's browser-based administration console,
which provides a UI for adding your own cartridges. (Sponger configuration using Conductor is
described in detail later.) The SYS_RDF_MAPPERS table definition is as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create table "DB"."DBA"."SYS_RDF_MAPPERS"
(
"RM_ID" INTEGER IDENTITY,  -- cartridge ID. Determines the order of the cartridge's invocation in the Sponger processing chain
"RM_PATTERN" VARCHAR,  -- a REGEX pattern to match the resource URL or MIME type
"RM_TYPE" VARCHAR,  -- which property of the current resource to match: "MIME" or "URL"
"RM_HOOK" VARCHAR,  -- fully qualified Virtuoso/PL function name
"RM_KEY" LONG VARCHAR,  -- API specific key to use
"RM_DESCRIPTION" LONG VARCHAR,  -- cartridge description (free text)
"RM_ENABLED" INTEGER,  -- a 0 or 1 integer flag to exclude or include the cartridge from the Sponger processing chain
"RM_OPTIONS" ANY,  -- cartridge specific options
"RM_PID" INTEGER IDENTITY,
PRIMARY KEY ("RM_PATTERN", "RM_TYPE")
);

    <sect3 id="virtuosospongeroverviewcartinvo">
      <title>Cartridge Invocation</title>
      <para>The Virtuoso SPARQL processor supports IRI dereferencing via the Sponger. If a SPARQL query
references non-default graph URIs, the Sponger goes out (via HTTP) to Fetch the Network Resource data source URIs and
inserts the extracted RDF data into the local RDF quad store. The Sponger invokes the appropriate
cartridge for the data source type to produce RDF instance data. If none of the registered cartridges
are capable of handling the received content type, the Sponger will attempt to obtain RDF instance
data via the in-built WebDAV metadata extractor.</para>
      <para>Sponger cartridges are invoked as follows:</para>
      <para>When the SPARQL processor dereferences a URI, it plays the role of an HTTP user agent
(client) that makes a content type specific request to an HTTP server via the HTTP request's Accept
headers. The following then occurs:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>If the content type returned is RDF then no further transformation is needed and
the process stops. For instance, when consuming an (X)HTML document with a GRDDL profile, the profile
URI points to a data provider that simply returns RDF instance data.</listitem>
        <listitem>If the content type is not RDF (i.e. application/rdf+xml or text/rdf+n3 ), for
instance 'text/plain', the Sponger looks in the Cartridge Registry iterating over every record for
which the RM_ENABLED flag is true, with the look-up sequence ordered on the RM_ID column values.
For each record, the processor tries matching the content type or URL against the RM_PATTERN value
and, if there is match, the function specified in RM_HOOK column is called. If the function doesn't
exist, or signals an error, the SPARQL processor looks at next record.
          <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
            <listitem>If the hook returns zero, the next cartridge is tried. (A cartridge function
can return zero if it believes a subsequent cartridge in the chain is capable of extracting more
RDF data.)</listitem>
            <listitem>If the result returned by the hook is negative, the Sponger is instructed
that no RDF was generated and the process stops. </listitem>
            <listitem>If the hook result is positive, the Sponger is informed that structured
data was retrieved and the process stops.</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>If none of the cartridges match the source data signature (content type or URL),
the ODS-Briefcase WebDAV metadata extractor and RDF generator is called.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para><emphasis>Meta-Cartridges</emphasis></para>
      <para>The above describes the RDF generation process for 'primary' Sponger cartridges. Virtuoso
also supports another cartridge type - a 'meta-cartridge'. Meta-cartridges act as post-processors in
the cartridge pipeline, augmenting entity descriptions in an RDF graph with additional information
gleaned from 'lookup' data sources and web services. Meta-cartridges are described in more detail in
a later section.</para>

easily identified from the 'Cartridge name' field of Conductor's 'RDF Cartridges' screen, after
selecting the cartridge of interest. The hook function code can be viewed from the 'Schema Objects'
screen under the 'Database' menu, by locating the function in the 'DB' > 'Procedures' folder.
Stylesheets used by the cartridges are installed in the WebDAV folder DAV/VAD/rdf_mappers/xslt.
This can be explored using Conductor's WebDAV interface. The actual rdf_mappers.sql file installed

        <para>If your cartridge should need to test whether other cartridges are configured to handle a

        <para><emphasis>Specifying the Target Graph</emphasis></para>
        <para>Two cartridge hook function parameters contain graph IRIs, graph_iri and dest. graph_iri
identifies an input graph being crawled. dest holds the IRI specified in any input:grab-destination
pragma defined to control the SPARQL processor's IRI dereferencing. The pragma overrides the default
behaviour and forces all retrieved triples to be stored in a single graph, irrespective of their graph
of origin.</para>
        <para>So, under some circumstances depending on how the Sponger has been invoked and whether
it is being used to crawl an existing RDF graph, or derive RDF data from a non-RDF data source,
dest may be null.</para>
        <para>Consequently, when loading network resource being fetched as RDF data into the quad store, cartridges typically
specify the graph to receive the data using the coalesce function which returns the first non-null
parameter. e.g.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

        <para>Here xd is an RDF/XML string holding the fetched RDF.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Specifying &amp; Retrieving Cartridge Specific Options</emphasis></para>
        <para>The hook function prototype allows cartridge specific data to be passed to a cartridge
through the RM_OPTIONS parameter, a Virtuoso/PL vector which acts as a heterogeneous array.</para>
        <para>In the following example, two options are passed, 'add-html-meta' and 'get-feeds'
with both values set to 'no'.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

        <para>The RM_OPTIONS vector can be handled as an array of key-value pairs using the
get_keyword function. get_keyword performs a case sensitive search for the given keyword at
every even index of the given array. It returns the element following the keyword, i.e.

        <para><emphasis>XSLT - The Fulchrum</emphasis></para>
        <para>XSLT is the fulchrum of all OpenLink supplied cartridges. It provides the most convenient
means of converting structured data extracted from web content by a cartridge's Entity Extractor into RDF.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Virtuoso's XML Infrastructure &amp; Tools</emphasis></para>
        <para>Virtuoso's XML support and XSLT support are covered in detail in the on-line documentation.
Virtuoso includes a highly capable XML parser and supports XPath, XQuery, XSLT and XML Schema validation.</para>
        <para>Virtuoso supports extraction of XML documents from SQL datasets. A SQL long varchar, long xml
or xmltype column in a database table can contain XML data as text or in a binary serialized format.
 A string representing a well-formed XML entity can be converted into an entity object representing
the root node.</para>
        <para>While Sponger cartridges will not normally concern themselves with handling XML extracted
from SQL data, the ability to convert a string into an in-memory XML document is used extensively.
The function xtree_doc(string) converts a string into such a document and returns a reference to the
document's root. This document together with an appropriate stylesheet forms the input for
the transformation of the extracted entities to RDF using XSLT. The input string to xtree_doc
generally contains structured content derived from a web service.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Virtuoso XSLT Support</emphasis></para>
        <para>Virtuoso implements XSLT 1.0 transformations as SQL callable functions. The xslt() Virtuoso/PL function
applies a given stylesheet to a given source XML document and returns the transformed document. Virtuoso
provides a way to extend the abilities of the XSLT processor by creating user defined XPath functions.
The functions xpf_extension() and xpf_extension_remove() allow addition and removal of XPath extension
functions.</para>
        <para><emphasis>General Cartridge Pipeline</emphasis></para>
        <para>The broad pipeline outlined here reflects the steps common to most cartridges:</para>
          <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
            <listitem>Redirect from the requested URL to a Web service which returns XML</listitem>
            <listitem>Stream the content into an in-memory XML document</listitem>
            <listitem>Convert it to the required RDF/XML, expressed in the chosen ontology, using XSLT</listitem>
            <listitem>Encode the RDF/XML as UTF-8</listitem>
            <listitem>Load the RDF/XML into the quad store</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        <para>The <ulink url="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</ulink> cartridge typifies this approach. MusicBrainz is a community music
metadatabase which captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships
between them. Artists always have a unique ID, so the URL
http://musicbrainz.org/artist/4d5447d7-c61c-4120-ba1b-d7f471d385b9.html takes you directly to entries
for John Lennon.</para>
        <para>If you were to look at this page in your browser, you would see that the information about
the artist contains no RDF data. However, the cartridge is configured to intercept requests to URLs of
the form http://musicbrainz.org/([^/]*)/([^.]*) and redirect to the cartridge to Fetch all the
available information on the given artist, release, track or label.</para>
        <para>The cartridge extracts entities by redirecting to the MusicBrainz XML Web Service using
as the basis for the initial query the item ID, e.g. an artist or label ID, extracted from the original
URL. Stripped to its essentials, the core of the cartridge is:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
webservice_uri := sprintf ('http://musicbrainz.org/ws/1/%s/%s?type=xml&inc=%U',
					kind, id, inc);
content := RDF_HTTP_URL_GET (webservice_uri, '', hdr, 'GET', 'Accept: */*');
xt := xtree_doc (content);
...
xd := DB.DBA.RDF_MAPPER_XSLT (registry_get ('_rdf_mappers_path_') || 'xslt/mbz2rdf.xsl', xt);
...
xd := serialize_to_UTF8_xml (xd);
DB.DBA.RM_RDF_LOAD_RDFXML (xd, new_origin_uri, coalesce (dest, graph_iri));
]]></programlisting>
        <para>In the above outline, RDF_HTTP_URL_GET sends a query to the MusicBrainz web service,
using query parameters appropriate for the original request, and retrieves the response using
Network Resource Fetch.</para>
        <para>The returned XML is parsed into an in-memory parse tree by xtree_doc. Virtuoso/PL
function RDF_MAPPER_XSLT is a simple wrapper around the function xslt which sets the current user
to dba before returning an XML document transformed by an XSLT stylesheet, in this case mbz2rdf.xsl.
Function serialize_to_UTF8_xml changes the character set of the in-memory XML document to UTF8.
Finally, RM_RDF_LOAD_RDFXML is a wrapper around RDF_LOAD_RDFXML which parses the content of an
RDF/XML string into a sequence of RDF triples and loads them into the quad store. XSLT stylesheets
are usually held in the DAV/VAD/rdf_mappers/xslt folder of Virtuoso's WebDAV store.
registry_get('rdf_mappers_path') returns the RDF Mappers VAD path, 'DAV/VAD/rdf_mappers', from the
Virtuoso registry.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Error Handling with Exit Handlers</emphasis></para>
        <para>Virtuoso condition handlers determine the behaviour of a Virtuoso/PL procedure when a
condition occurs. You can declare one or more condition handlers in a Virtuoso/PL procedure for
general SQL conditions or specific SQLSTATE values. If a statement in your procedure raises an
SQLEXCEPTION condition and you declared a handler for the specific SQLSTATE or SQLEXCEPTION
condition the server passes control to that handler. If a statement in your Virtuoso/PL procedure
raises an SQLEXCEPTION condition, and you have not declared a handler for the specific SQLSTATE
or the SQLEXCEPTION condition, the server passes the exception to the calling procedure (if any).
If the procedure call is at the top-level, then the exception is signaled to the calling client.</para>
        <para>A number of different condition handler types can be declared (see the <ulink url="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/handlingplcondit.html">Virtuoso reference documentation</ulink>
for more details.) Of these, exit handlers are probably all you will need. An example is shown below
which handles any SQLSTATE. Commented out is a debug statement which outputs the message describing
the SQLSTATE.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create procedure DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_SOCIALGRAPH (in graph_iri varchar, ...)
  {
  declare qr, path, hdr any;
  ...
  declare exit handler for sqlstate '*'
{

    return 0;
};
  ...
  -- data extraction and mapping successful
  return 1;
}
]]></programlisting>
        <para>Exit handlers are used extensively in the Virtuoso supplied cartridges. They are useful
for ensuring graceful failure when trying to convert content which may not conform to your expectations.
The RDF_LOAD_FEED_SIOC procedure (which is used internally by several cartridges) shown below uses this
approach:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

  xt := xtree_doc (content);
  xd := DB.DBA.RDF_MAPPER_XSLT (
      registry_get ('_rdf_mappers_path_') || 'xslt/feed2sioc.xsl', xt,
      vector ('base', graph_iri, 'isDiscussion', is_disc));
  xd := serialize_to_UTF8_xml (xd);
  DB.DBA.RM_RDF_LOAD_RDFXML (xd, iri, graph_iri);
  return 1;
no_sioc:
  return 0;
}
]]></programlisting>
        <para><emphasis>Loading RDF into the Quad Store</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>RDF_LOAD_RDFXML &amp; TTLP</emphasis></para>
        <para>The two main Virtuoso/PL functions used by the cartridges for loading RDF data into the
Virtuoso quad store are DB.DBA.TTLP and DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML. Multithreaded versions of these functions,
DB.DBA.TTLP_MT and DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML_MT, are also available.</para>
        <para>RDF_LOAD_RDFXML parses the content of an RDF/XML string as a sequence of RDF triples and
loads then into the quad store. TTLP parses TTL (Turtle or N3) and places its triples into quad
storage. Ordinarily, cartridges use RDF_LOAD_RDFXML. However there may be occasions where you want
to insert statements written as TTL, rather than RDF/XML, in which case you should use TTLP.</para>

graph an indication of the external ontologies being used. The attribution takes the form:</para>

with the same URI. To do so, select the 'RDF' > 'List of Graphs' menu commands in Conductor, then use
the 'Delete' command for the appropriate graph. Alternatively, you can use one of the following SQL
commands:</para>

        <para><emphasis>Proxy Service Data Expiration</emphasis></para>
        <para>When the Proxy Service is invoked by a user agent, the Sponger records the expiry date
of the imported data in the table DB.DBA.SYS_HTTP_SPONGE. The data invalidation rules conform to those
of traditional HTTP clients (Web browsers). The data expiration time is determined based on subsequent
data fetches of the same resource. The first data retrieval records the 'expires' header. On subsequent
fetches, the current time is compared to the expiration time stored in the local cache. If HTTP 'expires'
header data isn't returned by the source data server, the Sponger will derive its own expiration time by
evaluating the 'date' header and 'last-modified' HTTP headers.</para>

        <para>Many of the OpenLink cartridges create a resource description formed to a common "wrapper"
template which describes the relationship between the (usually) non-RDF source network resource being fetched 
and the RDF description generated by the Sponger. The wrapper is appropriate for resources which can
broadly be conceived as documents. It provides a generic minimal description of the source document,
but also links to the much more detailed description provided by the Sponger. So, instead of just
emitting a resource description, the Sponger factors the container into the generated graph constituting
the RDF description.</para>

Post. A separate SIOC types module (T-SIOC) extends the SIOC Core ontology by defining subclasses and
subproperties of SIOC terms. Subclasses include: AddressBook, BookmarkFolder, Briefcase, EventCalendar,
ImageGallery, Wiki, Weblog, BlogPost, Wiki plus many others.</para>
        <para>OpenLink Data Spaces (ODS) uses SIOC extensively as a data space "glue" ontology to
describe the base data and containment hierarchy of all the items managed by ODS applications
(Data Spaces). For example, ODS-Weblog is an application of type sioc:Forum. Each ODS-Weblog
application instance contains blogs of type sioct:Weblog. Each blog is a sioc:container_of posts
of type sioc:Post.</para>
        <para>Generally, when deciding how to describe resources handled by your own custom cartridge,
SIOC provides a useful framework for the description which complements the SIOC-based container model
adopted throughout the ODS framework.</para>

<para>
Used to extract RDF from a Web Data Source the Virtuoso Sponger Cartridge RDF Extractor consumes services from: Virtuoso PL, C/C++, Java
based RDF Extractors</para>
<para>The RDF mappers provide a way to extract metadata from non-RDF documents such as HTML pages,
images Office documents etc. and pass to SPARQL sponger (crawler which retrieve missing
source graphs). For brevity further in this article the "RDF mapper" we simply will call "mapper".
</para>
<para>The mappers consist of PL procedure (hook) and extractor, where extractor itself can be built
using PL, C or any external language supported by Virtuoso server.</para>
<para>Once the mapper is developed it must be plugged into the SPARQL engine by adding a record
in the table DB.DBA.SYS_RDF_MAPPERS.</para>
<para>If a SPARQL query instructs the SPARQL processor to retrieve target graph into local storage,
then the SPARQL sponger will be invoked. If the target graph IRI represents a dereferenceable URL
then content will be retrieved using content negotiation. The next step is the content type
to be detected:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>If RDF and no further transformation such as GRDDL is needed, then the process would stop.</listitem>
<listitem>If such as 'text/plain' and is not known to have metadata, then the SPARQL sponger will
look in the DB.DBA.SYS_RDF_MAPPERS table by order of RM_ID and for every matching URL or MIME
type pattern (depends on column RM_TYPE) will call the mapper hook.
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>If hook returns zero the next mapper will be tried;</listitem>
    <listitem>If result is negative the process would stop instructing the SPARQL nothing was retrieved;</listitem>
    <listitem>If result is positive the process would stop instructing the SPARQL that metadata was retrieved.</listitem>

      <title>Meta-Cartridges</title>
        <para>So far the discussion has centered on 'primary' cartridges. However,
Virtuoso supports an alternative type of cartridge, a 'meta-cartridge'. The way a
meta-cartridge operates is essentially the same as a primary cartridge, that is it
has a cartridge hook function with the same signature and its inserts data into the
quad store through entity extraction and ontology mapping as before. Where meta-cartridges
differ from primary cartridges is in their intent and their position in the cartridge
invocation pipeline.</para>
        <para>The purpose of meta-cartridges is to enrich graphs produced by other (primary)
cartridges. They serve as general post-processors to add additional information about selected
entities in an RDF graph. For instance, a particular meta-cartridge might be designed to search
for entities of type 'umbel:Country' in a given graph, and then add additional statements about
each country it finds, where the information contained in these statements is retrieved from the
web service targeted by the meta-cartridge. One such example might be a 'World Bank' meta-cartridge
which adds information relating to a country's GDP, its exports of goods and services as a percentage
of GDP etc; retrieved using the <ulink url="http://developer.worldbank.org/docs/">World Bank web service API</ulink>.
In order to benefit from the World Bank meta-cartridge, any primary cartridge which might generate instance data relating to countries should
ensure that each country instance it handles is also described as being of rdf:type 'umbel:Country'.
Here, the <ulink url="http://wiki.umbel.org/index.php/Welcome">UMBEL</ulink> (Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer) ontology is used as a data-source-agnostic
classification system. It provides a core set of 20,000+ subject concepts which act as "a fixed set of
reference points in a global knowledge space". The use of UMBEL in this way serves to decouple
meta-cartridges from primary cartridges and data source specific ontologies.</para>
        <para>Virtuoso includes two default meta-cartridges which use
UMBEL and <ulink url="http://www.opencalais.com/">OpenCalais</ulink> to augment source graphs.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Registration</emphasis></para>
        <para>Meta-cartridges must be registered in the RDF_META_CARTRIDGES table, which fulfills a role
similar to the SYS_RDF_MAPPERS table used by primary cartridges. The structure of the table, and the
meaning and use of its columns, are similar to SYS_RDF_MAPPERS. The meta-cartridge hook function
signature is identical to that for primary cartridges.</para>
        <para>The RDF_META_CARTRIDGES table definition is as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

        <para>The example which follows builds on a Freebase Sponger cartridge developed prior to the announcement of Freebase's
support for generating Linked Data through the endpoint http://rdf.freebase.com/ . The OpenLink cartridge
has since evolved to reflect these changes. A snapshot of the Freebase cartridge and stylesheet compatible
with this example can be found <link linkend="virtuosospongerfreeb">here</link>.</para>
        <para><ulink url="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</ulink> is an open community database of the world's information which serves facts
and statistics rather than articles. Its designers see this difference in emphasis from article-oriented
databases as beneficial for developers wanting to use Freebase facts in other websites and applications.</para>
        <para>Virtuoso includes a Freebase cartridge in the rdf_mappers VAD. The aim of the example cartridge presented here is to provide a lightweight
meta-cartridge that is used to conditionally add triples to graphs generated by the Freebase cartridge,
if Freebase is describing a U.S. senator.</para>

        <para>The API supports a number of query types. To keep this example from being overly long,

        <para><ulink url="http://www.pingthesemanticweb.com/">PingtheSemanticWeb</ulink> (PTSW) is a repository for RDF documents. The PTSW web service
archives the location of recently created or updated RDF documents on the Web. It is intended
for use by crawlers or other types of software agents which need to know when and where the
latest updated RDF documents can be found. They can request a list of recently updated documents
as a starting location to crawl the Semantic Web.</para>
        <para>You may find this service useful for publicizing your own RDF content. Content authors can
notify PTSW that an RDF document has been created or updated by pinging the service with the URL of
the document. The Sponger supports this facility through the async_queue and ping_service parameters
of the cartridge hook function, where the ping_service parameter contains the ping service URL as
configured in the SPARQL section of the virtuoso.ini file:</para>

  <para>This section contains the generic steps to use Python language to extend the Virtuoso Sponger.</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>Build the latest Python hosting module. It will introduce a new function <code>python_exec ()</code>
<para>The parameters of python_exec are :</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>string containing a python code, it should define one or more functions, see remarks below</listitem>
  <listitem>string containing name of function to be called</listitem>
  <listitem>list of parameters for the function </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
<para>For Example:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
python_exec (file_to_string ('spoonge.py'), 'rdf4uri', 'http://url..', 'http://base...');
]]></programlisting>
<para>The above means call the rdf4uri ('http://url..', 'http://base...') function from spoonge.py file. 
It is importnat to know that python_exec is restricted to DBA only group and that the python source 
should not have __main__ or this to be restricted in python code to not be called . 
Any print etc. for stdout/stderr will go on server console if server is on foreground. 
Can be used for debug for example but not for real work. </para>
<para>The function is supposed to return just single string, don't try to return multiple results, 
this will not work in this revision. 
</para>
</listitem>
      <listitem>Setup the Virtuoso server INI to include python module:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
...

...
]]></programlisting>      	
      </listitem>
      <listitem>Download and install the rdflib package from http://www.rdflib.net/
Note before to build, disable Zope interface in rdflib as this not work with C-API correctly. 
Or make sure Python has no Zope interfaces installed. 
To disable the zope in rdflib, just comment out following in &lt;rdflibhome&gt;/rdflib/__init__.py:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
 36 #from rdflib.interfaces import IIdentifier, classImplements
 37 #classImplements(URIRef, IIdentifier)
 38 #classImplements(BNode, IIdentifier)
 39 #classImplements(Literal, IIdentifier)

<para>Then do:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
perl setup.py build
perl setup.py --user install	
]]></programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>Get an example of python code for sponger like: http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/wiki/Python4Spongers

<title>Virtuoso Faceted Web Service</title>
<para>The Virtuoso Faceted web service is a general purpose RDF query facility for facet based browsing.
It takes an XML description of the view desired and generates the reply as an XML tree containing the
requested data. The user agent or a local web page can use XSLT for rendering this for the end user.
The selection of facets and values is represented as an XML tree. The rationale for this is the fact
that such a representation is easier to process in an application than the SPARQL source text or a
parse tree of SPARQL and more compactly captures the specific subset of SPARQL needed for faceted
browsing. The web service returns the SPARQL source text also, thus this can serve as a basis for
and-crafted queries.</para>
<para>The top element of the tree is &lt;query&gt;, it must be in namespace
"http://openlinksw.com/services/facets/1.0/".</para>
<para>This has the following attributes:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>graph="graph_iri" - default is search in all graphs but system defaults may override this</listitem>
  <listitem>timeout="no_of_msec" - default is no timeout, but system defaults may override this</listitem>
  <listitem>inference="name" where name is a name of an inference context declared with rdfs_rule_set.</listitem>
  <listitem>same-as="boolean" - If "boolean" is "yes", then owl:sameAs links will be considered in the query evaluation.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The result is a tree of the form:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<facets xmlns="http://openlinksw.com/services/facets/1.0/">
<result><row><column datatype="..." shortform="..." xml:lang="..">...</column></row></result>
<time>msecs</time>
<complete>yes or no</complete>
<db-activity>resource use string</db-activity>
<sparql>sparql statement text</sparql>
</facets>
]]></programlisting>
<para>By convention, the first column is the subject selected by the view element, typically a URI, the second a label of the URI
and the third, if present, is either a count or a search summary.</para>
<para>The first column's text child is the text form of the value. The column element has the following attributes
qualifying this further:</para>
        <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>datatype - The xsd type of the value. If this is a URI, the datatype is "uri" </listitem>
  <listitem>shortform - If the value is a URI, this is an abbreviated form where known namespaces are replaced with
their prefixes and very long URI's are truncated preserving start and end. </listitem>
  <listitem>xml:lang - if the value is a language tagged string, this is the language</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
<para>The query has the top level element &lt;query&gt;. The child elements of this represent conditions
pertaining to a single subject. A join is expressed with the property or property-of element. This has
in turn children which state conditions on a property of the first subject. property and property-of
elements can be nested to an arbitrary depth and many can occur inside one containing element. In this way,
tree-shaped structures of joins can be expressed.</para>
<para>Expressing more complex relationships, such as intermediate grouping, subqueries, arithmetic or
such requires writing the query in SPARQL. The XML format is a shorthand for easy automatic composition
of queries needed for showing facets, not a replacement for SPARQL.</para>
<para>A facet query contains a single view element. This specifies which subject of the joined
subjects is shown. Its attributes specify the manner of viewing, e.g. list of distinct values, distinct
values with occurrence counts, properties or classes of the selected subjects etc.</para>
<para>The top query element or any property or property-of element can have the following types of children:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<text property="iri">text pattern</text>
]]></programlisting>
<para>The subject has an O that matches the text pattern. If property is given, the text pattern must
occur in a value of this property. If not specified, any property will do. The value "none" for property
is the same as not specifying a property. This is restricted to occurring directly under the top level
query element.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<class iri="iri" inference="ctx_name" />
]]></programlisting>
<para>The S must be an instance of this class. If inference is specified then option (input:inference

<para>The child elements of this are conditions that apply to the value of this property of the S that
is in scope in the enclosing &lt;query&gt; or &lt;property&gt; element. If same_as is present, then
option (input:same-as "yes") is added to the triple pattern which specifies this property. If inference
is present, then option (input:inference "ctx_name") is added to the triple pattern for the property.</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<property-of iri="iri" same_as="yes" inference="ctx_name" >
]]></programlisting>
<para>The child elements of this are conditions that apply to an S which has property "iri" whose object
is the S in scope in the enclosing &lt;query&gt; or &lt;property&gt; element. The options are otherwise
the same as with property.</para>

<para>When this occurs inside &lt;property&gt; or &lt;property-of&gt; this means that the property in
scope has the specified relation to the value. type and language can be used for XML typed or language
tagged literals. The "uri" type means that the value is a qualified name of a URI. If this occurs
directly under the &lt;query&gt; element, this means that the query starts with a fixed subject.
If this is so, then there must be property or propertyof elements or the view element must specify
properties or classes, list is not allowed as a view type. This is so because the query must have
at least one triple pattern.</para>

<view type="view" limit="n" offset="n" >

<para>This may occur once inside a &lt;query&gt; element but may occur either at top level or inside

<sect1 id="rdfiridereferencing"><title>Linked Data</title>
<para>There are many cases when RDF data should be retrieved from remote sources only when really needed.
E.g., a scheduling application may read personal calendars from personal sites of its users.
Calendar data expire quickly, so there's no reason to frequently re-load them in hope that they are queried before expired.
</para>
<para>Virtuoso extends SPARQL so it is possible to download RDF resource from a given IRI, parse them and store the resulting triples in a graph, all three operations will be performed during the SPARQL query execution.
The IRI of graph to store triples is usually equal to the IRI where the resource is download from, so the feature is named &quot;IRI dereferencing&quot;
There are two different use cases for this feature.
In simple case, a SPARQL query contains <emphasis>from</emphasis> clauses that enumerate graphs to process, but there are no triples in <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> that correspond to some of these graphs.
The query execution starts with dereferencing of these graphs and the rest runs as usual.
In more sophisticated case, the query is executed many times in a loop.
Every execution produces a partial result.
SPARQL processor checks for IRIs in the result such that resources with that IRIs may contain relevant data but not yet loaded into the <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis>.
After some iteration, the partial result is identical to the result of the previous iteration, because there's no more data to retrieve.
As the last step, SPARQL processor builds the final result set.
</para>
<sect2 id="rdfinputgrab"><title>IRI Dereferencing For FROM Clauses, &quot;define get:...&quot; Pragmas</title>
<para>Virtuoso extends SPARQL syntax of <emphasis>from</emphasis> and <emphasis>from named</emphasis> clauses.
It allows additional list of options at end of clause: <emphasis>option ( param1 value1, param2 value2, ... )</emphasis>
where parameter names are QNames that start with <emphasis>get:</emphasis> prefix and values are &quot;precode&quot; expressions, i.e. expressions that does not contain variables other than external parameters.
Names of allowed parameters are listed below.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><emphasis>get:soft</emphasis> is the retrieval mode, supported values are &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;replacing&quot;.
If the value is &quot;soft&quot; then the SPARQL processor will not even try to retrieve triples if the destination graph is non-empty.
Other <emphasis>get:...</emphasis> parameters are useless without this one.</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>get:uri</emphasis> is the IRI to retrieve if it is not equal to the IRI of the <emphasis>from</emphasis> clause.
These can be used if data should be retrieved from a mirror, not from original resource location or in any other case when the destination graph IRI differs from the location of the resource.</listitem>

  <listitem><emphasis>get:method</emphasis> is the HTTP method that should be used to retrieve the resource, supported methods are &quot;GET&quot; for plain HTTP and &quot;MGET&quot; for URIQA web service endpoint.
By default, &quot;MGET&quot; is used for IRIs that end with &quot;/&quot; and &quot;GET&quot; for everything else.</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>get:refresh</emphasis> is the maximum allowed age of the cached resource, no matter what is specified by the server where the resource resides.
The value is an positive integer (number of seconds). Virtuoso reads HTTP headers and uses &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;ETag&quot;, &quot;Expires&quot;, &quot;Last-Modified&quot;, &quot;Cache-Control&quot; and &quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot; fields to calculate when the resource should be reloaded, this value can become smaller due to <emphasis>get:refresh</emphasis> but can not be incremented.</listitem>

It can make text shorter and it is especially useful when the query text comes from client but the parameter should have a fixed value due to security reasons:
the values set by <emphasis>define get:...</emphasis> can not be redefined inside the query and the application may prevent the text with desired pragmas before the execution.

Consider a set of personal data such that one resource can list many persons and point to resources where that persons are described in more details.
E.g. resource about <emphasis>user1</emphasis> describes the user and also contain statements that <emphasis>user2</emphasis> and <emphasis>user3</emphasis> are persons and more data can be found in <emphasis>user2.ttl</emphasis> and <emphasis>user3.ttl</emphasis>,
<emphasis>user3.ttl</emphasis> can contain statements that <emphasis>user4</emphasis> is also person and more data can be found in <emphasis>user4.ttl</emphasis> and so on.
The query should find as many users as it is possible and return their names and e-mails.

The IRI dereferencing is controlled by the following pragmas:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-var</emphasis> specifies a name of variable whose values should be used as IRIs of resources that should be downloaded.
It is not an error if the variable is sometimes unbound or gets values that can not be converted to IRIs (e.g., integers) -- bad values are silently ignored.
It is also not an error if the IRI can not be retrieved, this makes IRI retrieval somewhat similar to &quot;best effort union&quot; in SQL.
This pragma can be used more than once to specify many variable names.
It is not an error if values of different variables result in same IRI or a variable gets same value many times -- no one IRI is retrieved more than once.</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-iri</emphasis> specifies an IRI that should be retrieved before executing the rest of the query, if it is not in the <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> already.
This pragma can be used more than once to specify many IRIs.
The typical use of this pragma is querying a set of related resources when only one &quot;root&quot; resource IRI is known but even that resource is not loaded.</listitem>

  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-seealso</emphasis> (and synonym <emphasis>input:grab-follow-predicate</emphasis>) specifies an IRI of an predicate similar to foaf:seeAlso.
Predicates of that sort suggest location of resources that contain more data about predicate subject.
The IRI dereferencing routine may use these predicates to find additional IRIs for loading resources.
This is especially useful when the text of the query comes from remote client and may lack triple patterns like
<emphasis><![CDATA[optional { ?id <SeeAlso> ?more }]]></emphasis> from the previous example.
The use of <emphasis>input:grab-seealso</emphasis> makes the SPARQL query nondeterministic, because the order and the number of retrieved documents will
depend on execution plan and they may change from run to run.
This pragma can be used more than once to specify many IRIs, but this feature is costly.
Every additional predicate may result in significant number of lookups in the RDF storage, affecting total execution time.</listitem>

  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-limit</emphasis> should be an integer that is a maximum allowed number of resource retrievals.
The default value is pretty big (few millions of documents) so it is strongly recommended to set smaller value.
Set it even if you're absolutely sure that the set of resources is small, because program errors are always possible.
All resource downloads are counted, both successful and failed, both forced by <emphasis>input:grab-iri</emphasis> and forced by <emphasis>input:grab-var</emphasis>.
Nevertheless, all constant IRIs specified by <emphasis>input:grab-iri</emphasis> (or <emphasis>input:grab-all</emphasis>) are downloaded before the first check of the <emphasis>input:grab-limit</emphasis> counter,
so this limit will never prevent from downloading &quot;root&quot; resources.
</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-depth</emphasis> should be an integer that is a maximum allowed number of query iterations.
Every iteration may find new IRIs to retrieve, because resources loaded on previous iteration may add these IRIs to <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD</emphasis> and make result set longer.
The default value is 1, so the SPARQL processor will retrieve only resources explicitly named in &quot;root&quot; resources or in quad that are in the database before the query execution.
</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-base</emphasis> specifies a base IRI used to convert relative IRIs into absolute. The default is an empty string.</listitem>

  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-resolver</emphasis> is a name of procedure that resolve IRIs and determines the HTTP method of retrieval.
The default is name of <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_GRAB_RESOLVER_DEFAULT()</emphasis> procedure that is described below.
If other procedure is specified, the signature should match to the default one.</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-destination</emphasis> is to override the default behaviour of the IRI dereferencing and store all retrieved triples in a single graph.
This is convenient when there's no logical difference where any given triple comes from, and changes in remote resources will only add triples but not make cached triples obsolete.
A SPARQL query is usually faster when all graph IRIs are fixed and there are no graph group patterns with an unbound graph variable, so storing everything in one single graph is worth considering.
</listitem>
  <listitem><emphasis>input:grab-loader</emphasis> is a name of procedure that retrieve the resource via HTTP, parse it and store it.
The default is name of <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_SPONGE_UP()</emphasis> procedure; this procedure also used by IRI dereferencing for FROM clauses.
You will probably never need to write your own procedure of this sort but some Virtuoso plugins will provide ready-to-use functions that will retrieve non-RDF resources and extract their metadata as triples or
will implement protocols other than HTTP.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Default resolver procedure is <emphasis>DB.DBA.RDF_GRAB_RESOLVER_DEFAULT()</emphasis>. Note that the function produce two absolute URIs,
<emphasis>abs_uri</emphasis> and <emphasis>dest_uri</emphasis>. Default procedure returns two equal strings, but other may return different values,
e.g., return primary and permanent location of the resource as <emphasis>dest_uri</emphasis> and the fastest known mirror location as
<emphasis>abs_uri</emphasis> thus saving HTTP retrieval time. It can even signal an error to block the downloading of some unwanted resource.</para>

<sect2 id="urlrewriting"><title>URL rewriting</title>
<para>URL rewriting is the act of modifying a source URL prior to the final processing of that URL by a
Web Server.</para>
<para>The ability to rewrite URLs may be desirable for many reasons that include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Changing Web information resource URLs on the a Web Server without breaking existing bookmarks
held in User Agents (e.g., Web browsers)</listitem>
<listitem>URL compaction where shorter URLs may be constructed on a conditional basis for specific User
Agents (e.g. Email clients)</listitem>
<listitem>Construction of search engine friendly URLs that enable richer indexing since most search
engines cannot process parameterized URLs effectively.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
  <sect3 id="usingurlrewritesolelinkdpl">
			<title>Using URL Rewriting to Solve Linked Data Deployment Challenges</title>
<para>URI naming schemes don't resolve the challenges associated with referencing data. To reiterate,
this is demonstrated by the fact that the URIs http://demo.openlinksw.com/Northwind/Customer/ALFKI
and http://demo.openlinksw.com/Northwind/Customer/ALFKI#this both appear as
http://demo.openlinksw.com/Northwind/Customer/ALFKI to the Web Server, since data following the
fragment identifier "#" never makes it that far.</para>
<para>The only way to address data referencing is by pre-processing source URIs
(e.g. via regular expression or sprintf substitutions) as part of a URL rewriting
processing pipeline. The pipeline process has to take the form of a set of rules
that cater for elements such as HTTP Accept headers, HTTP response code, HTTP response
headers, and rule processing order.</para>
<para>An example of such a pipeline is depicted in the table below.</para>
<table><title>Pre-processing source URIs</title>

<thead><row>
<entry>URI Source(Regular Expression Pattern)</entry>

</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>
<para>The source URI patterns refer to virtual or physical directories for ex. at http://demo.openlinksw.com/.
Rules can be placed at the head or tail of the pipeline, or applied in the order they are declared,
by specifying a Rule Processing Order of First, Last, or Normal, respectively. The decision as to
which representation to return for URI http://demo.openlinksw.com/Northwind/Customer/ALFKI is based
on the MIME type(s) specified in any Accept header accompanying the request.</para>
<para>In the case of the last rule, the Alternates response header applies only to response code 406.
406 would be returned if there were no (X)HTML representation available for the requested resource.
In the example shown, an alternative representation is available in RDF/XML.</para>
<para>When applied to matching HTTP requests, the last two rules might generate responses similar to those below:</para>

<para>Virtuoso provides a URL rewriter that can be enabled for URLs matching specified patterns.
Coupled with customizable HTTP response headers and response codes, Data-Web server administrators
can configure highly flexible rules for driving content negotiation and URL rewriting. The key
elements of the URL rewriter are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Rewriting rule</listitem>
<listitem>Each rule describes how to parse a single source URL, and how to compose the URL of
the page ultimately returned in the "Location:" response headers</listitem>

<listitem>Two types of rule are supported, based on the syntax used to describe the source
URL pattern matching: sprintf-based and regex-based.</listitem>

			<title>"Nice" URLs vs. "Long" URLs</title>
<para>Although we are approaching the URL Rewriter from the perspective of deploying linked data,
the Rewriter was developed with additional objectives in mind. These in turn have influenced
the naming of some of the formal argument names in the Configuration API function prototypes.
In the following sections, long URLs are those containing a query string with named parameters;
nice (aka. source) URLs have data encoded in some other format. The primary goal of the Rewriter
is to accept a nice URL from an application and convert this into a long URL, which then
identifies the page that should actually be retrieved.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="urlrewriterulesprocessmechanic">
			<title>Rule Processing Mechanics</title>
<para>When an HTTP request is accepted by the Virtuoso HTTP server, the received nice URL is
passed to an internal path translation function. This function takes the nice URL and, if
the current virtual directory has a url_rewrite option set to an existing ruleset name, tries
to match the corresponding rulesets and rules; that is, it performs a recursive traversal
of any rulelist associated with it. For every rule in the rulelist, the same logic is
applied (only the logic for regex-based rules is described; that for sprintf-based rules
is very similar):
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>The input for the rule is the resource URL as received from the HTTP header, i.e.,
the portion of the URL from the first '/' after the host:port fields to the end of the URL.</listitem>
<listitem>The input is normalized.</listitem>
<listitem>The input is matched against the rule's regex. If the match fails, the rule is not
applied and the next rule is tried. If the match succeeds, the result is a vector of values.</listitem>
<listitem>If the URL contains a query string, the names and values of the parameters are decoded by
split_and_decode().</listitem>
<listitem>The names and values of any parameters in the request body are also decoded.</listitem>
<listitem>The destination URL is composed</listitem>
<listitem>The value of each parameter in the destination URL is taken from (in order of priority)</listitem>
<listitem>The value of a parameter in the match result;</listitem>
<listitem>The value of a named parameter in the query string of the input nice URL;</listitem>
<listitem>If the original request was submitted by the POST method, the value of a named parameter
in the body of the POST request; or</listitem>
<listitem>if a parameter value cannot be derived from one of these sources, the rule is not applied
and the next rule is tried.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The path translation function described above is internal to the Web server, so its signature
is not appropriate for Virtuoso/PL calls and thus is not published. Virtuoso/PL developers can
harness the same functionality using the DB.DBA.URLREWRITE_APPLY API call.

<para>The output above shows how RDF entities from the Data-Web, in this case customer ALFKI,
are exposed in the Document Web. The power of SPARQL coupled with URL rewriting enables us to
produce results in line with the desired representation. A SPARQL SELECT or CONSTRUCT query is
used depending on whether the requested representation is text/html or application/rdf+xml,
respectively.</para>
<para>The 404 response in Example 3 indicates that no HTML representation is available for entity
ALFKI#this. In most cases, a URI of this form (containing a '#' fragment identifier) will
not reach the server. This example supposes that it does: i.e., the RDF client and network
routing allows the suffixed request. The presence of the #this suffix implicitly states
that this is a request for a data resource in the Data-Web realm, not a document resource
from the Document Web.2</para>
<para>Rather than return 404, we could instead choose to construct our rewriting rules to
perform a 303 redirect, so that the response for ALFKI#this in Example 3 becomes the same
as that for ALFKI in Example 1.</para>

   <title>Transparent Content Negotiation</title>
<para>So as not to overload our preceding description of Linked Data deployment with excessive
detail, the description of content negotiation presented thus far was kept deliberately brief.
This section discusses content negotiation in more detail.
</para>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontenthttp"><title>HTTP/1.1 Content Negotiation</title>
<para>Recall that a resource (conceptual entity) identified by a URI may be associated
with more than one representation (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, sizes, resolutions).
If multiple representations are available, the resource is referred to as negotiable and
each of its representations is termed a variant. For instance, a Web document resource, named
'ALFKI' may have three variants: alfki.xml, alfki.html and alfki.txt all representing the same data.
Content negotiation provides a mechanism for selecting the best variant.</para>
<para>As outlined in the earlier brief discussion of content negotiation, when a user agent
requests a resource, it can include with the request Accept headers (Accept, Accept-Language,
Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding etc.) which express the user preferences and user agent
capabilities. The server then chooses and returns the best variant based on the Accept headers.
Because the selection of the best resource representation is made by the server, this
scheme is classed as server-driven negotiation.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontenttransperant"><title>Transparent Content Negotiation</title>
<para>An alternative content negotiation mechanism is Transparent Content Negotiation (TCN),
a protocol defined by RFC2295 . TCN offers a number of benefits over standard HTTP/1.1 negotiation,
for suitably enabled user agents.</para>
<para>RFC2295 introduces a number of new HTTP headers including the Negotiate request header,
and the TCN and Alternates response headers. (Krishnamurthy et al. note that although the
HTTP/1.1 specification reserved the Alternates header for use in agent driven negotiation,
it was not fully specified. Consequently under a pure HTTP/1.1 implementation as defined by
RFC2616, server-driven content negotiation is the only option. RFC2295 addresses this issue.)</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontentdefic"><title>Deficiencies of HTTP/1.1 Server-Driven Negotiation</title>
<para>Weaknesses of server-driven negotiation highlighted by RFCs 2295 and 2616 include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Inefficiency - Sending details of a user agent's capabilities and preferences
with every request is very inefficient, not least because very few Web resources have
multiple variants, and expensive in terms of the number of Accept headers required to
fully describe all but the most simple browser's capabilities.</listitem>
<listitem>Server doesn't always know 'best' - Having the server decide on the 'best' variant
may not always result in the most suitable resource representation being returned to
the client. The user agent might often be better placed to decide what is best for its needs.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontentvariantagent"><title>Variant Selection By User Agent</title>
<para>Rather than rely on server-driven negotiation and variant selection by the server,
a user agent can take full control over deciding the best variant by explicitly requesting
transparent content negotiation through the Negotiate request header. The negotiation is
'transparent' because it makes all the variants on the server visible to the agent.</para>
<para>Under this scheme, the server sends the user agent a list, represented in an
Alternates header, containing the available variants and their properties. The user
agent can then choose the best variant itself. Consequently, the agent no longer
needs to send large Accept headers describing in detail its capabilities
and preferences. (However, unless caching is used, user-agent driven negotiation does
suffer from the disadvantage of needing a second request to obtain the best representation.
By sending its best guess as the first response, server driven negotiation avoids this
second request if the initial best guess is acceptable.)</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontentvariantserver"><title>Variant Selection By Server</title>
<para>As well as variant selection by the user agent, TCN allows the server to choose on
behalf of the user agent if the user agent explicitly allows it through the Negotiate
request header. This option allows the user agent to send smaller Accept headers
containing enough information to allow the server to choose the best variant and
return it directly. The server's choice is controlled by a 'remote variant selection
algorithm' as defined in RFC2296.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="urlrewritetransperantcontentvariantuser"><title>Variant Selection By End-User</title>
<para>A further option is to allow the end-user to select a variant, in case the choice made
by negotiation process is not optimal. For instance, the user agent could display an
HTML-based 'pick list' of variants constructed from the variant list returned by the server.
Alternatively the server could generate this pick list itself and include it in the response
to a user agent's request for a variant list. (Virtuoso currently responds this way.)</para>

   <title>Transparent Content Negotiation in Virtuoso HTTP Server</title>
<para>The following section describes the Virtuoso HTTP server's TCN implementation
which is based on RFC2295, but without "Feature" negotiation. OpenLink's RDF rich clients,
iSparql and the OpenLink RDF Browser, both support TCN. User agents which do not support
transparent content negotiation continue to be handled using HTTP/1.1 style content
negotiation (whereby server-side selection is the only option - the server selects
the best variant and returns a list of variants in an Alternates response header).</para>

<sect2 id="rdfiridereferencingfacet"><title>Faceted Views over Large-Scale Linked Data</title>
<para>Faceted views over structured and semi structured data have been popular in user interfaces for
some years. Deploying such views of arbitrary linked data at arbitrary scale has been hampered by lack
of suitable back end technology. Many ontologies are also quite large, with hundreds of thousands of
classes.
</para>
<para>Also, the linked data community has been concerned with the processing cost and potential for
denial of service presented by public SPARQL end points.
</para>
<para>This section discusses how we use Virtuoso Cluster Edition for providing interactive browsing over
billions of triples, combining full text search, structured querying and result ranking. We discuss query
planning, run-time inferencing and partial query evaluation. This functionality is exposed through SPARQL,
a specialized web service and a web user interface.</para>
<para>The transition of the web from a distributed document repository into a universal, ubiquitous
database requires a new dimension of scalability for supporting rich user interaction. If the web is the
database, then it also needs a query and report writing tool to match. A faceted user interaction paradigm
has been found useful for aiding discovery and query of variously structured data. Numerous implementations
exist but they are chiefly client side and are limited in the data volumes they can handle.
</para>
<para>At the present time, linked data is well beyond prototypes and proofs of concept. This means that
what was done in limited specialty domains before must now be done at real world scale, in terms of both
data volume and ontology size. On the schema, or T box side, there exist many comprehensive general purpose
ontologies such as Yago[1], OpenCyc[2], Umbel[3] and the DBpedia[4] ontology and many domain specific
ones, such as [5]. For these to enter into the user experience, the platform must be able to support
the user's choice of terminology or terminologies as needed, preferably without blow up of data and
concomitant slowdown.
</para>
<para>Likewise, in the LOD world, many link sets have been created for bridging between data sets.
Whether such linkage is relevant will depend on the use case. Therefore we provide fine grained control
over which owl:sameAs assertions will be followed, if any.
</para>
<para>Against this background, we discuss how we tackle incremental interactive query composition on
arbitrary data with <link linkend="clusteroperation">Virtuoso Cluster</link>.
</para>
<para>Using SPARQL or a web/web service interface, the user can form combinations of text search and
structured criteria, including joins to an arbitrary depth. If queries are precise and select a limited
number of results, the results are complete. If queries would select tens of millions of results, partial
results are shown.
</para>
<para>The system being described is being actively developed as of this writing, early March of 2009
and is online at http://lod.openlinksw.com/. The data set is a combination of DBpedia, MusicBrainz,
Freebase, UniProt, NeuroCommons, Bio2RDF, and web crawls from PingTheSemanticWeb.com.
</para>
<para>The hardware consists of two 8-core servers with 16G RAM and 4 disks each. The system runs on
Virtuoso 6 Cluster Edition. All application code is written in SQL procedures with limited client side
Ajax, the Virtuoso platform itself is in C.
</para>
<para>The facets service allows the user to start with a text search or a fixed URI and to refine the
search by specifying classes, property values etc., on the selected subjects or any subjects referenced
therefrom.
</para>
<para>This process generates queries involving combinations of text and structured criteria, often
dealing with property and class hierarchies and often involving aggregation over millions of subjects,
specially at the initial stages of query composition. To make this work with in interactive time, two
things are needed:
</para>
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>a query optimizer that can almost infallibly produce the right join order based on cardinalities of
the specific constants in the query</listitem>
  <listitem>a query execution engine that can return partial results after a timeout.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>It is often the case, specially at the beginning of query formulation, that the user only needs
to know if there are relatively many or few results that are of a given type or involve a given property.
Thus partially evaluating a query is often useful for producing this information. This must however be
possible with an arbitrary query, simply citing precomputed statistics is not enough.
</para>
<para>It has for a long time been a given that any search-like application ranks results by relevance.
Whenever the facets service shows a list of results, not an aggregation of result types or properties,
it is sorted on a composite of text match score and link density.
</para>
<para>The section is divided into the following parts:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>SPARQL query optimization and execution adapted for run time inference over large subclass
structures.</listitem>
  <listitem>Resolving identity with inverse functional properties</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
  <sect3 id="rdfiridereferencingfacetprlh"><title>Processing Large Hierarchies in SPARQL</title>
<para>Virtuoso has for a long time had built-in superclass and superproperty inference. This is enabled by
specifying the <emphasis>DEFINE input:inference "context"</emphasis> option, where context is previously
declared to be all subclass, subproperty, equivalence, inverse functional property and same as relations
defined in a given graph. The ontology file is loaded into its own graph and this is then used to construct
the context. Multiple ontologies and their equivalences can be loaded into a single graph which then makes
another context which holds the union of the ontology information from the merged source ontologies.
</para>
<para>
Let us consider a sample query combining a full text search and a restriction on the class of the desired
matches:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
DEFINE  input:inference  "yago"
PREFIX  cy:  <http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?s1 AS ?c1
                ( bif:search_excerpt
                  ( bif:vector ( 'Shakespeare' ), ?o1 )
                ) AS ?c2
WHERE
  {
    ?s1  ?s1textp ?o1                         .
    FILTER
      ( bif:contains (?o1, '"Shakespeare"') ) .
    ?s1  a        cy:Performer110415638
  }
LIMIT 20
]]></programlisting>
<para>This selects all Yago performers that have a property that contains "Shakespeare" as a whole word.
</para>
<para>The <emphasis>DEFINE input:inference "yago"</emphasis> clause means that subclass, subproperty and
inverse functions property statements contained in the inference context called yago are considered when
evaluating the query. The built-in function <emphasis>bif:search_excerpt</emphasis> makes a search engine style summary of
the found text, highlighting occurrences of Shakespeare.
</para>
<para>The <emphasis>bif:contains</emphasis> function in the filter specifies the full text search
condition on ?o1.
</para>
<para>This query is a typical example of queries that are executed all the time when a user refines a
search. We will now look at how we can make an efficient execution plan for the query. First, we must
know the cardinalities of the search conditions.
</para>
<para>To see the count of subclasses of Yago performer, we can do:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
PREFIX  cy:  <http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/>
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM <http://dbpedia.org/yago.owl>
WHERE
  {
    ?s  rdfs:subClassOf  cy:Performer110415638
    OPTION (TRANSITIVE, T_DISTINCT)
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>There are 4601 distinct subclasses, including indirect ones. Next we look at how many Shakespeare
mentions there are:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
SELECT COUNT (*)
WHERE
  {
    ?s  ?p  ?o .
    FILTER
      ( bif:contains (?o, 'Shakespeare') )
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>There are 10267 subjects with Shakespeare mentioned in some literal.
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
DEFINE input:inference "yago"
PREFIX cy: <http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/>
SELECT COUNT (*)
WHERE
  {
    ?s1  a  cy:Performer110415638
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>There are 184885 individuals that belong to some subclass of performer.
</para>
<para>This is the data that the SPARQL compiler must know in order to have a valid query plan. Since
these values will wildly vary depending on the specific constants in the query, the actual database
must be consulted as needed while preparing the execution plan. This is regular query processing
technology but is now specially adapted for deep subclass and subproperty structures.
</para>
<para>Conditions in the queries are not evaluated twice, once for the cardinality estimate and once
for the actual run. Instead, the cardinality estimate is a rapid sampling of the index trees that reads
at most one leaf page.
</para>
<para>Consider a B tree index, which we descend from top to the leftmost leaf containing a match of
the condition. At each level, we count how many children would match and always select the leftmost one.
When we reach a leaf, we see how many entries are on the page. From these observations, we extrapolate
the total count of matches.
</para>
<para>With this method, the guess for the count of performers is 114213, which is acceptably close to the
real number. Given these numbers, we see that it makes sense to first find the full text matches and
then retrieve the actual classes of each and see if this class is a subclass of performer. This last
check is done against a memory resident copy of the Yago hierarchy, the same copy that was used for
enumerating the subclasses of performer.
</para>
<para>However, the query
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SPARQL
DEFINE input:inference "yago"

SELECT DISTINCT ?s1 AS ?c1,

                  ( bif:vector ('Shakespeare'), ?o1 )
                ) AS ?c2
WHERE
  {
    ?s1  ?s1textp  ?o1                         .
    FILTER
      ( bif:contains (?o1, '"Shakespeare"') )  .
    ?s1  a         cy:ShakespeareanActors
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>will start with Shakespearean actors since this is a leaf class with only 74 instances and then
check if the properties contain Shakespeare and return their search summaries.
</para>
<para>In principle, this is common cost based optimization but is here adapted to deep hierarchies
combined with text patterns. An unmodified SQL optimizer would have no possibility of arriving at
these results.
</para>
<para>The implementation reads the graphs designated as holding ontologies when first needed and
subsequently keeps a memory based copy of the hierarchy on all servers. This is used for quick iteration
over sub/superclasses or properties as well as for checking if a given class or property is a
subclass/property of another. Triples with OWL predicates <emphasis>equivalentClass</emphasis>,
<emphasis>equivalentProperty</emphasis> and <emphasis>sameAs</emphasis> are also cached in the same data
structure if they occur in the ontology graphs.
</para>
<para>Also cardinality estimates for members of classes near the root of the class hierarchy take
some time since a sample of each subclass is needed. These are cached for some minutes in the
inference context, so that repeated queries will not redo the sampling.
</para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 id="rdfiridereferencingfacetinvfpr"><title>Inverse Functional Properties and Same As</title>
<para>Specially when navigating social data, as in FOAF and SIOC spaces, there are many blank nodes that
are identified by properties only. For this, we offer an option for automatically joining to subjects

<para>we get 4022. We note that there are many duplicates since the data is blank nodes only,
with people easily represented 10 times. The context <emphasis>b3sifp</emphasis> simple declares that
<emphasis>foaf:name</emphasis> and <emphasis>foaf:mbox</emphasis> sha1sum should be treated as inverse
functional properties (IFP). The name is not an IFP in the actual sense but treating it as such for
the purposes of this one query makes sense, otherwise nothing would be found.
</para>
<para>This option is controlled by the choice of the inference context, which is selectable in the
interface discussed below.
</para>
<para>The IFP inference can be thought of as a transparent addition of a subquery into the join sequence.
The subquery joins each subject to its synonyms given by sharing IFPs. This subquery has the special
property that it has the initial binding automatically in its result set. It could be expressed as:

<para>It is true that each subject shares IFP values with itself but the transitive construct with 0
minimum and 1 maximum depth allows passing the initial binding of <emphasis>?org</emphasis> directly to
<emphasis>?syn</emphasis>, thus getting first results more rapidly. The <emphasis>rdf_is_sub</emphasis>
function is an internal that simply tests whether <emphasis>?p</emphasis> is a subproperty of
<emphasis>b3s:any_ifp</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>Internally, the implementation has a special query operator for this and the internal form is more
compact than would result from the above but the above could be used to the same effect.
</para>
<para>Our general position is that identity criteria are highly application specific and thus we offer
the full spectrum of choice between run time and precomputing. Further, weaker identity statements than
sameness are difficult to use in queries, thus we prefer identity with semantics of
<emphasis>owl:sameAs</emphasis> but make this an option that can be turned on and off query by query.

<para>Here the query returns subjects, thus no text search summaries, so only the entity rank of the
returned subject is used. We order text results by a composite of text hit score and entity rank of the
RDF subject where the text occurs. The entity rank of the subject is defined by the count of references
to it, weighed by the rank of the referrers and the outbound link count of referrers. Such techniques
are used in text based information retrieval.

<para>One interesting application of entity rank and inference on IFPs and <emphasis>owl:sameAs</emphasis> is in locating
URIs for reuse. We can easily list synonym URIs in order of popularity as well as locate URIs based
on associated text. This can serve in application such as the Entity Name Server
</para>
<para>Entity ranking is one of the few operations where we take a precomputing approach. Since a rank is
calculated based on a possibly long chain of references, there is little choice but to precompute. The
precomputation itself is straightforward enough: First all outbound references are counted for all
subjects. Next all ranks of subjects are incremented by 1 over the referrer's outbound link count.
On successive iterations, the increment is based on the rank increment the referrer received in
the previous round.
</para>
<para>The operation is easily partitioned, since each partition increments the ranks of subjects it
holds. The referrers are spread throughout the cluster, though. When rank is calculated, each partition
accesses every other partition. This is done with relatively long messages, referee ranks are accessed
in batches of several thousand at a time, thus absorbing network latency.
</para>
<para>On the test system, this operation performs a single pass over the corpus of 2.2 billion triples
and 356 million distinct subjects in about 30 minutes. The operation has 100% utilization of all 16
cores. Adding hardware would speed it up, as would implementing it in C instead of the SQL procedures
it is written in at present.
</para>
<para>The main query in rank calculation is:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

SELECT O            ,
       P            ,
       iri_rank (S)
FROM rdf_quad TABLE
OPTION (NO CLUSTER)
WHERE isiri_id(O)
ORDER BY O
]]></programlisting>
<para>This is the SQL cursor iterated over by each partition. The no cluster option means that only rows
in this process's partition are retrieved. The RDF_QUAD table holds the RDF quads in the store, i.e.,
triple plus graph. The S, P, O columns are the subject, predicate, and object respectively. The graph
column is not used here. The textttiri rank is a partitioned SQL function. This works by using the S
argument to determine which cluster node should run the function. The specifics of the partitioning
are declared elsewhere. The calls are then batched for each intended recipient and sent when the
batches are full. The SQL compiler automatically generates the relevant control structures. This
is like an implicit map operation in the map-reduce terminology.
</para>
<para>An SQL procedure loops over this cursor, adds up the rank and when seeing a new O, the added
rank is persisted into a table. Since links in RDF are typed, we can use the semantics of the link
to determine how much rank is transferred by a reference. With extraction of named entities from
text content, we can further place a given entity into a referential context and use this as a
weighting factor. This is to be explored in future work. The experience thus far shows that we
greatly benefit from Virtuoso being a general purpose DBMS, as we can create application specific
data structures and control flows where these are efficient. For example, it would make little
sense to store entity ranks as triples due to space consumption and locality considerations. With
these tools, the whole ranking functionality took under a week to develop.

  <sect3 id="rdfiridereferencingfacetqel"><title>Query Evaluation Time Limits</title>
<para>When scaling the Linked Data model, we have to take it as a given that the workload will be
unexpected and that the query writers will often be unskilled in databases. Insofar possible, we
wish to promote the forming of a culture of creative reuse of data. To this effect, even poorly
formulated questions deserve an answer that is better than just timeout.
</para>
<para>If a query produces a steady stream of results, interrupting it after a certain quota is simple.
However, most interesting queries do not work in this way. They contain aggregation, sorting, maybe
transitivity.
</para>
<para>When evaluating a query with a time limit in a cluster setup, all nodes monitor the time left
for the query. When dealing with a potentially partial query to begin with, there is little point in
transactionality. Therefore the facet service uses read committed isolation. A read committed query
will never block since it will see the before-image of any transactionally updated row. There will
be no waiting for locks and timeouts can be managed locally by all servers in the cluster.
</para>
<para>Thus, when having a partitioned count, for example, we expect all the partitions to time out
around the same time and send a ready message with the timeout information to the cluster node
coordinating the query. The condition raised by hitting a partial evaluation time limit differs
from a run time error in that it leaves the query state intact on all participating nodes. This
allows the timeout handling to come fetch any accumulated aggregates.
</para>
<para>Let us consider the query for the top 10 classes of things with "Shakespeare" in some literal.
This is typical of the workload generated by the faceted browsing web service:

<para>It is a well known fact that running from memory is thousands of times faster than from disk.
</para>
<para>The query plan begins with the text search. The subjects with "Shakespeare" in some property get
dispatched to the partition that holds their class. Since all partitions know the class hierarchy,
the superclass inference runs in parallel, as does the aggregation of the group by. When all
partitions have finished, the process coordinating the query fetches the partial aggregates,
adds them up and sorts them by count.
</para>
<para>If a timeout occurs, it will most likely occur where the classes of the text matches are being
retrieved. When this happens, this part of the query is reset, but the aggregate states are left
in place. The process coordinating the query then goes on as if the aggregates had completed. If
there are many levels of nested aggregates, each timeout terminates the innermost aggregation that
is still accumulating results, thus a query is guaranteed to return in no more than n timeouts,
where n is the number of nested aggregations or subqueries.

  <sect3 id="rdfiridereferencingfacetws"><title>Faceted Web Service and Linked Data</title>
<para>The Virtuoso Faceted Web Service is a general purpose RDF query facility for Faceted based browsing.
It takes an XML description of the view desired and generates the reply as an XML tree containing the
requested data. The user agent or a local web page can use XSLT for rendering this for the end user.
The selection of facets and values is represented as an XML tree. The rationale for this is the fact
that such a representation is easier to process in an application than the SPARQL source text or a
parse tree of SPARQL and more compactly captures the specific subset of SPARQL needed for faceted
browsing. All such queries internally generate SPARQL and the SPARQL generated is returned with
the results. One can therefore use this is a starting point for hand crafted queries.
</para>
<para>The query has the top level element. The child elements of this represents conditions pertaining
to a single subject. A join is expressed with the property or propertyof element. This has in turn
children which state conditions on a property of the first subject. Property and propertyof elements
can be nested to an arbitrary depth and many can occur inside one containing element. In this way,
tree-shaped structures of joins can be expressed.
</para>
<para>Expressing more complex relationships, such as intermediate grouping, subqueries, arithmetic or
such requires writing the query in SPARQL. The XML format is for easy automatic composition of queries
needed for showing facets, not a replacement for SPARQL.

<sect1 id="rdfsparqlrule"><title>Inference Rules &amp; Reasoning</title>
<sect2 id="rdfsparqlruleintro"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Virtuoso SPARQL can use an inference context for inferring triples that are not physically stored.
This functionality applies to physically stored quads and not to virtual triples generated from relational data with Linked Data Views.
Such an inference context can be built from one or more graphs containing RDF Schema triples. The supported
RDF Schema or OWL constraints are imported from these graphs and are grouped together into rule bases.
A rule base is a persistent entity that can be referenced by a SPARQL query or end point. Queries running
with a given rule base work as if the triples asserted by this rule base were included in the graph or graphs accessed by the query.
</para>
<para>As of version 5.0, Virtuoso recognizes <emphasis>rdfs:subClassOf</emphasis> and <emphasis>rdfs:subPropertyOf</emphasis>.
owl:sameAs is considered for arbitrary subjects and objects if specially enabled by a pragma in the query.
As of 5.00.3031, owl:sameAs, owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty are also considered when determining subclass or subproperty relations.  If two  classes are equivalent, they share all instances, subclasses and superclasses directly or indirectly stated in the data for either class.
Other RDF Schema or OWL information is not taken into account.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsparqlrulemake"><title>Making Rule Sets</title>
<para>Since RDF Schema and OWL schemas are RDF graphs, these can be loaded into the triple store. Thus, in order to use
such a schema as query context, one first loads the corresponding document into the triple store using <emphasis>ttlp</emphasis> or
<emphasis>rdf_load_rdfxml</emphasis> or related functions. After the schema document is loaded, one can add the assertions therein
into an inference context with the <emphasis>rdfs_rule_set</emphasis> function. This function specifies a logical name for the rule
set plus a graph URI. It is possible to combine multiple schema graphs into a single rule set. A single schema
graph may also independently participate in multiple rule sets.
</para>
<programlisting>
rdfs_rule_set (in name varchar, in uri varchar, in remove int := 0)
</programlisting>
<para>This function adds the applicable facts of the graph into a rule set. The graph URI must correspond
to the graph IRI of a graph stored in the triple store of the Virtuoso instance. If the remove argument
is true, the specified graph is removed from the rule set instead.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsparqlrulechange"><title>Changing Rule Sets</title>
<para>Changing a rule set affects queries made after the change. Some queries may have been previously
compiled and will not be changed as a result of modifying the rule set. When a rule set is changed, i.e.
when <emphasis>rdfs_rule_set</emphasis> is called with the first argument set to a pre-existing rule set's name, all the graphs
associated with this name are read and the relevant facts are added to a new empty rule set. Thus, if
triples are deleted from or added to the graphs comprising the rule set, calling <emphasis>rdfs_rule_set</emphasis> will refresh
the rule set to correspond to the state of the stored graphs.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsparqlrulesubclassandsubprop"><title>Subclasses and Subproperties</title>
  <para>Virtuoso SPARQL supports RDF Schema subclasses and subproperties.</para>
<para>The predicates <emphasis>rdfs:subClassOf</emphasis> and <emphasis>rdfs:subPropertyOf</emphasis> are
recognized when they appear in graphs included in a rule set. When such a rule set is specified as a context
for a SPARQL query, the following extra triples are generated as needed.
</para>
<para>For every <emphasis>?s rdf:type ?class</emphasis>, a triple <emphasis>?s rdf:type ?superclass</emphasis> is considered to exist,
such that <emphasis>?superclass</emphasis> is a direct or indirect superclass of <emphasis>?class</emphasis>. Direct superclasses are
declared with the <emphasis>rdfs:subClassOf</emphasis> predicate in the rule set graph. Transitivity of superclasses
is automatically taken into account, meaning that if a is a superclass of b and b a superclass of c,
then a is a superclass of c also. Cyclic superclass relations are not allowed. If such occur in the rule set data,
the behavior is undefined but will not involve unterminating recursion.
</para>
<para>For every <emphasis>?s ?subpredicate ?o</emphasis>, a triple <emphasis>?s ?superpredicate ?o</emphasis>
is considered to exist if the rule context declares <emphasis>?superpredicate</emphasis> to be a superpredicate
of <emphasis>?predicate</emphasis>. This is done by having the triple <emphasis>?subpredicate rdfs:subPropertyOf ?superpredicate</emphasis>
as part of the graphs making up the rule context. Transitivity is observed, thus if a is a subpredicate of b and b
a subpredicate of c, then a is also a subpredicate of c.
</para>

  <para>Two methods can be used for typical recursions, transitivity on inference and plain transitive patterns 
(or subqueries).</para>
  <para>The advantage of inference is that queries are short and one inference rule set may be maintained for 
numerous queries.</para>
  <para>If queries are about trees of classes or properties, or about equivalences of nodes, consider using 
inference rule sets.</para>
  <para>Transitive patterns are inconvenient and may easily result in queries that runs too long or hard 
to debug, but they're unavoidable in traversing social networks or plain querying of RDF lists.</para>
  <para>So consider a rule set, a handful of nodes with classes from the rule set and a couple of RDF 
Lisp-style lists defined on demo.openlinksw.com:</para>

<sect2 id="rdfsameas"><title>OWL sameAs Support</title>
<para>
Virtuoso has limited support for the OWL sameAs predicate.
</para>
<para>
If sameAs traversal is enabled and a triple pattern with a given
subject or object is being matched, all the synonyms of the S and O
will be tried and results generated for all the tried bindings of S
and O. The set of synonyms is generated at run time by following all
owl:sameAs triples where the IRI in question is either the subject or
the object. These are followed recursively from object to subject and
subject to object until the complete transitive closure is generated.
All sameAs triples from all the graphs applicable to instantiating
the triple pattern at hand are considered.

</para>




<para>
If binding a variable in a pattern where the variable was free, we do not expand the value to the complete set of its synonyms.
</para>
<para>
Same-as expansion is enabled in a query by <emphasis>define input:same-as "yes"</emphasis> in the beginning of the SPARQL query.
This has a significant run time cost but is in some cases useful when joining data between sets which are mapped to each other with same-as.
</para>
<para>
We note that the number of same-as expansions will depend on the join order used for the SPARQL query.
The compiler does not know the number of synonyms and cannot set the join order accordingly.
Regardless of the join order we will however get at least one IRI of the each synonym set as answer.
Also when interactively navigating a graph with a browser, the same-as expansion will take all synonyms into account.
</para>
<para>
For getting the complete entailment of same-as, a forward
chaining approach should be used, effectively asserting all the
implied triples.

<sect2 id="rdfsparqlruleintro"><title>Implementation</title>
<para>Triples entailed by subclass or subproperty statements in an inference context are not physically stored.
Such triples are added to the result set by the query run time as needed. Also queries involving subclass or subproperty
rules are not rewritten into unions of all the possible triple patterns that might imply the pattern that is requested.
Instead, the SQL compiler adds special nodes that iterate over subclasses or subproperties at run time. The cost model
also takes subclasses and subproperties into account when determining the approximate cardinality of triple patterns.
</para>
<para>In essence, Virtuoso's support for subclasses and subproperties is backward chaining, i.e. it does not materialize
all implied triples but rather looks for the basic facts implying these triples at query evaluation time.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="rdfsparqlruleintro"><title>Enabling Inferencing</title>
<para>In a SPARQL query, the define input:inference clause is used to instruct the compiler to use the rules in the named rule set. For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
SQL> rdfs_rule_set ('sample', 'rule_graph');

SQL> SPARQL
define input:inference "sample"
SELECT *
FROM &lt;g&gt;
WHERE {?s ?p ?o};
</programlisting>
<para>will include all the implied triples in the result set, using the rules in the sample rule set.
</para>
<para>Inference can be enabled triple pattern by triple pattern. This is done with the option
(inference 'rule_set') clause after the triple pattern concerned. Specifying option (inference none)
will disable inference for the pattern concerned while the default inference context applies to the
rest of the patterns. Note that the keyword is input:inference in the query header and simply inference
in the option clause. See the examples section below for examples.
</para>
<para>In SQL, if RDF_QUAD occurs in a select from clause, inference can be added with the table option <emphasis>WITH</emphasis>, as follows:
</para>
<programlisting>
SPARQL
SELECT *
FROM rdf_quad table OPTION (with 'sample')
WHERE g = iri_to_id ('xx', 0);
</programlisting>
<para>This is about the same as:

<programlisting>
SPARQL
define input:inference "sample"
SELECT *

WHERE {?s ?p ?o}

  <sect2 id="rdfsparqlruleinversefunc"><title>Identity With Inverse Functional Properties </title>
  <para>A graph used used with rdfs_rule_set may declare certain properties to
  be inversely functional. If one or more inverse functional properties (IFP's)
  are declared in the inference context used with the query, enabled
  with define input:inference = "context_name", then the following
  semantics apply:</para>
  <orderedlist>
  <listitem>If a literal is compared with an IRI, then the literal is substituted by all the subject IRI's where this literal occurs as a value of an IFP.</listitem>
  <listitem>If two IRI's are compared for equality, they will be considered the same if there is an IFP P such that the same P has the same value on both subjects.</listitem>
  <listitem>If an IRI is processed for distinctness in either distinct or group by, the IRI is first translated to be the IRI with the lowest ID among all IRI's that share an IFP value with this IRI.</listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>Thus, if two IRI's are compared for distinctness, they will count as one if there is an IFP P with the same value with both IRI's. Literal data types are not translated into IRI's even if these literals occurred as IFP values of some subject.</para>
  <para>It is possible to declare that specific values, even if they occur as values of an IFP in more than onme subject do not constitute identity between the subjects.
  For example, if two subjects were inferred to be the same because they had the same foaf:mbox_sha1sum, the SHA1 hash of mailto:// would be excluded. Two individuals have an email address that has a common default value are not the same.
  </para>
  <para>In an ontology graph, a property IRI is declared to be inversely
  functional by making it an instance of the
  owl:InverseFunctionalProperty class. A value of an IFP can be
  declared null, i.e. sharing the value does not imply identity by by
  giving the IFP IRI a
  &lt;http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#nullIFPValue> property with
  the value to be ignored as the object.

<sect1 id="rdfsparqlgeospat"><title>RDF and Geometry</title>
<para>A geometry may occur as an object of an RDF quad. The SQL MM functions can then 
	be used for geospatial queries.
</para>
<para>
For geometry functions, see the <link linkend="sqlrefgeospatial">SQL Geometry support section</link>.
</para>
<para>A geometry may occur as an object value in an RDF quad. In such a
case, the bare geometry object is not used but instead a special RDF
typed literal is made with the type virtrdf:Geometry. Such a literal
is automatically indexed in an R tree index containing all distinct
geometries occurring in any quad of any graph under any predicate.
Normally, WGS84, SRID 4326 is the SRID of any such geometry.
</para>
<para>In this section, the geo namespace prefix is used to mean &lt;http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#&gt;.
</para>
<para>The preferred way of adding geometries to RDF graphs is with the ttlp and related functions
which parse a text string in the Turtle syntax and insert the result in a graph.
</para>
<para>For example:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
ttlp ('@prefix virtrdf: <http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#>
<point> geo:geometry "point(1.2 22.4"^^virtrdf:Geometry .',
'xxx', 'graph');
]]></programlisting>
<para>A typed literal whose text is a WKT representation of a geometry and whose type is virtrdf:geometry
creates a geometry object and adds it to the R tree index of all RDF geometries.
</para>
<para>
Geometries can be queried with geometry predicates, st_intersects, st_contains and st_within, as follows.
As usual, the bif: namespace is used since these are SQL built-in functions.

  <sect2 id="rdfsparqlgeospatprog"><title>Programmatic Manipulation of Geometries in RDF</title>
<para>The <link linkend="fn_ttlp"><function>ttlp</function></link> function is the preferred
way of inserting geometries. The more are inserted at one time, the more efficient the operation is.
This loader function will also deal with cluster message optimization.
</para>
<para>For deleting quads with geometries, normal
<link linkend="rdfsparqlimplementationextent">SPARUL operations</link> apply.
</para>
<para>A geometry occurring in an RDF quad object is a member of the RDF box data type. This data type
stands for a typed RDF literal. The type of all geometries is 256. This is mapped to a URI in
the RDF_DATATYPE system table.
</para>
<para>A geometry does not occur directly in the object position of a quad. It is referenced by an id
that is stored in the RDF typed literal box and references RO_ID of the RDF_OBJ system table.
To translate a geometry into a RDF box that can be stored, do as in the example below:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
INSERT INTO RDF_QUAD (g, s, p, o)
VALUES (
         "g",
         "s",
         iri_to_id ('http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#geometry'),
         DB.DBA.rdf_geo_add (rdf_box (st_point (lng, lat), 256, 257, 0, 1)));
]]></programlisting>
<para>The DB.DBA.RDF_GEO_ADD function looks if an identical geometry already exists and if so assigns the
existing id to it. If the geometry is new, it gets a new ID and is stored in the RDF literals
table RDF_OBJ. At this time it is also automatically inserted into the RDF geometry index.
</para>
<para>In a cluster situation one should use the dpipe mechanism for inserting into RDF quad so as to
get large numbers of inserts into a single message. This is essential for performance.
</para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="rdfsparqlgeospatcrg"><title>Creating Geometries From RDF Data</title>
<para>Many data sets use the geo:lat and geo:long properties for describing a position.
Virtuoso comes with a function for converting these properties into geometries. This operation
reads through all graphs and for each subject with at least one geo:lat and geo:long, a point
geometry is made for each distinct lat/long pair where lat and long are in the same graph. It
should not happen in practice that a single subject has multiple lats or long within one graph.
If this still happens, a geometry is made for each combination.
The geometry is added to the subject with the lat and long as the value of the geo:geometry property.
This is added to the same graph where the lat and long were.
</para>
<para>The SQL procedure DB.DBA.RDF_GEO_FILL () performs this operation. This is performed in parallel on
multiple threads and is optimized for cluster execution. This is done without transaction logging
and is not transactional. To make the result persistent, the operator should do an explicit checkpoint.
This is done by executing:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SQL>cl_exec ('checkpoint');
]]></programlisting>
<para>on any process of a cluster or single server.
Otherwise the result may be lost if the server terminates abnormally before an automatic checkpoint is made.
</para>
<para>The DB.DBA.RDF_GEO_FILL procedure may in principle be called several times but it will read
every lat and long in the database. This is inefficient if there are large numbers of geometries.
</para>
<para>Application logic must generally be used for constructing geometries and adding these to RDF subjects.
It is easiest for the application to construct a text representation of the geometries in TTL and to
use the <link linkend="fn_ttlp"><function>ttlp</function></link> function for loading this.
</para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="rdfsparqlgeospatusg"><title>Using Geometries With Existing Databases</title>
<para>
The geometry feature is compatible with any Virtuoso 6 databases.
Once geometries are used, the database should not be opened with a
server older than the one used for first inserting geometries, older
servers will consider the storage format a physical corruption.

<sect1 id="rdfreplication"><title>RDF Replication</title>
<para>
Tables of RDF storage, such as DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD and DB.DBA.RDF_OBJ, can not be replicated in a usual way,
because it's content is cached in memory in special ways and synchronized with values outside these tables,
such as current values of special sequence objects.
Moreover, same IRI may have different internal IRI_IDs on different boxes, because the assigned IDs vary if new IRIs appear in data in different order.
Similarly, there will be different IDs of RDF literal, datatypes and languages, blocking any attempt of one-to-one replication between RDF storages.</para>
<para>
However, a special asynchronous RDF replication makes it possible to configure a "publisher" Virtuoso instance to keep the log of changes in some RDF graphs
and subscribe some Virtuoso instances to replay all these changes.</para>
<para>
Configuration functions are quite straightforward.</para>
<para>
RDF graphs to replicate are all members of &lt;http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#rdf_repl_graph_group&gt; graph group.
That group can be filled in with graphs like any other graph group, but it is better to get the advantage of proper security check made by

Only publicly readable graphs can be replicated, an error is signalled otherwise, and it is better to know about a security issue as early as possible.</para>

</funcprototype>
<para>
starts the RDF replication at the publishing side.
It creates replication "publication" named '__rdf_repl' and makes a log file '__rdf_repl.log' to record changes in replicated graphs.
If the replication has been started before then an error is signalled; passing value 1 for parameter "quiet" elimintaes the error so the incorrect call has no effect at all.
If the replication is enabled then the value of registry variable 'DB.DBA.RDF_REPL' indicates the moment of replication start.</para>
<para>
<function>DB.DBA.RDF_REPL_START</function>() performs a security check before starting the replication to check.</para>

It calls <function><link linkend="fn_repl_unpublish">repl_unpublish</link></function> but does not make empty reates replication "publication" named '__rdf_repl' and makes a log file '__rdf_repl.log' to record changes in replicated graphs.</para>
<para>
Replication is asynchronous and the order of insertion and removal operations at the subscriber's side may not match the order at the publisher.
As a result, it is not recommended to make few subscriptions that writes changes of few publishers into one common graph.
A client-side application can force the synchronuzation by calling</para>

that acts like <function><link linkend="fn_repl_sync">repl_sync</link></function> but for an RDF subscription.
<function>DB.DBA.RDF_REPL_SYNC</function> will not only initial synchronisation but also wait for the end of subscription to guarantee that the total effect of INSERT and DELETE operations is correct even if these operations were made in an order that differs from the original one.</para>

<para>
The idea is to favor queries where the predicate is specified in
triple patterns. The entire quad can be efficiently accessed when P
and either or both S and O are known. This has the advantage of
clustering data by the predicate which improves working set: A page
read from disk will only have entries pertaining to the same
predicate, chances of accessing other entries of the page are thus
higher than if the page held values for arbitrary predicates. For
less frequent cases where only S is known, as in describe, the
distinct P's of the S are found in the SP index. These SP pairs are
then used for accessing the PSOG index to get the O and G. For cases
where only the G is known, as in dropping a graph, the distinct S's of
the G are found in the GS index. The P's of the S are then found in
the SP index. After this the whole quad is found in the PSOG index.
</para>

<para>
The SP, OP and GS indices do not store duplicates. If a S has many
values of the P, there is only one entry. Extries are not deleted
from SP, OP or GS. This does not lead to erroneous results since a
full index, that is either POSG or PSOG is always consulted in order
to know if a quad actually exists. For cases of updating data, most
often a graph is entirely dropped and a substantially similar graph is
inserted in its place. The SP, OP and GS indices get to stay relatively unaffected.
</para>

<para>
Still over time specially if there are frequent updates and values do not repeat between
consecutive states the SP, OP and GS indices will get polluted which may affect performance.
Dropping and recreating the index will then remedy the situation.
</para>

<para>
For cases where this is not practical the index scheme should only have full indices, i.e.
each key holds all columns of the primary key of the quad. This will be the case if the
distinct no primary key ref options are not specified in the create index statement. In
such cases all indices remain in strict sync across deletes.
</para>

<para>
Many RDF workloads have bulk load and read intensive access patterns with few deletes.
The default index scheme is optimized for these. With these situations this scheme offers
significant space savings resulting in better working set. Typically this layout takes
60-70% of the space of a layout with 4 full indices.

<para>Public web service endpoints are proven to be sources of especially bad queries. While local
application develpers can obtain instructions from database administrator and use ISQL access to
the database in order to tune execution plans, &quot;external&quot; clients do not know details of
configuration and/or lacks appropriate skills. The most common problem is that public endpoints usually
get requests that does not mention the required graph, because that queries were initially written for
use with triple stores. If the web service provides access to a single graph (or to a short list of graphs)
then it is strongly recommended to configure it by adding a row into
<emphasis>DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST</emphasis>:</para>

<para>You can find detailed descriptions of the table columns <link linkend="rdfdefaultgraph">here</link>.</para>
<para>The idea is that if the client specifies default graph in
the request or uses named graphs and group graph patterns then he is probably smarter than average and
will provide meaningful queries. If no graph names are specified then the query will benefit from
preset graph because this will give the compiler some more indexes to choose from -- indexes that begin
with G.</para>
<para>Sometimes web service endpoint is used to access data of only one application, not all data in the

<para>One will see in the output that the first table access is to retrieve

from left to right.</para>
<para>It is very easy to end up with completely unworkable query plans in
this manner but if the optimizer really is in error, then this is the
only way of overriding its preferences. The effect of <emphasis>sql:select-option</emphasis> is pervasive, extending inside unions, optionals, subqueries etc within the statement.</para>
<para>We note that if, in the above query, both the course taken by the
student and the type of the student are given, the query compilation
will be, at least for all non-cluster cases, an index intersection.
This is not overridden by the sql:select-option clause since an index
intersection is always a safe guess, regardless of the correctness of
the cardinality guesses of the patterns involved.</para>

<para>The RDF_QM_TREE_DUMP procedure and its associated procedures below are used 
for dumping one or more RDFView Graphs in a Virtuoso server to a set of 
turtle ttl dataset files in the specified dump directory. The dump generation 
is made as fast as possible by grouping mappings by underlying tables so many 
properties from neighbor database columns can be extracted in one table scan. 
The size of the generated files is limited to 5MB. The dump process creates 
internal stored procedures; their texts are saved in file .dump_procedures.sql in 
the directory of dump files for debugging purposes.
</para>

<para>Note that the dump directory must be included in the <code>DirsAllowed</code> 
parameter of the Virtuoso configuration file (e.g., <code>virtuoso.ini</code>), or the 
server will not be allowed to create nor access the dataset file(s).
</para>

<para>
The <ulink url="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VirtBulkRDFLoader">Virtuoso RDF bulk loader</ulink> 
scripts can then be used to load the dumped datasets for the RDFView graphs directly into 
a Virtuoso RDF QUAD store.

    <sect2 id="rdfperfloading"><title>Loading RDF</title>
	<para>There are many functions for loading RDF text, in RDF/XML and Turtle.</para>
	<para>For loading RDF/XML, the best way is to split the data to be loaded into
multiple streams and load these in parallel using <link linkend="fn_rdf_load_rdfxml"><function>RDF_LOAD_RDFXML ()</function></link>.
To avoid running out of rollback space for large files and in order to have multiple concurrent loads not
interfere with each other, the row autocommit mode should be enabled.</para>
	<para>For example, </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
log_enable (2);
-- switch row-by-row autocommit on and logging off for this session
DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML (file_to_string_output ('file.xml'), 'base_uri', 'target_graph');
-- more files here ...
checkpoint;
]]></programlisting>
<para>Loading a file with text like the above with isql will load the data. Since the transaction
logging is off, make a manual checkpoint at the end to ensure that data is persisted upon server
restart since there is no roll forward log.</para>
<para>If large amounts of data are to be loaded, run multiple such streams in parallel. One may have
for example 6 streams for 4 cores. This means that if up to two threads wait for disk, there is still work
for all cores.</para>
<para>Having substantially more threads than processors or disks is not particularly useful.</para>
<para>There exist multithreaded load functions which will load one file on multiple threads: 
<link linkend="rdfapidataimportttlpmt">the DB.DBA.TTLP_MT() function</link> and 
<link linkend="rdfapidataimportxmlttlpmt">the DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML_MT() function</link>. Experience
shows that loading multiple files on one thread per file is better.</para>
<para>For loading Turtle, some platforms may have a non-reentrant Turtle parser. This means that only
one load may run at a time. One can try this by calling
<link linkend="rdfapidataimport"><function>ttlp ()</function></link> from two sessions at the same time.
If these do not execute concurrently, then the best way may be to try
<link linkend="rdfapidataimport"><function>ttlp_mt</function></link> and see if this runs faster than
a single threaded ttlp call.</para>
       <sect3 id="rdfperfloadingutility"><title>RDF Bulk Load Utility</title>
         <para>The RDF loader utility facilitates parallel bulk loading of multiple RDF files. The utility 
         	maintains a database table containing a list of files to load and the status of each file, 
         	whether not loaded, loaded or loaded with error. The table also records load start and 
         	end times.</para>
         <para>One must have a dba group login for using this and the virtuoso.ini file access 
         	control list must be set up so that the Virtuoso server can open  the files to load.</para>
         <para>Files are added to the load list with the function <link linkend="fn_ld_dir"><function>ld_dir</function></link>:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

         <para>The file mask is a SQL like pattern to match against the files in the directory.

<programlisting><![CDATA[

         <para>would load the RDF in all files ending in .gz from the directory given as first parameter.

         <para>If NULL is given for the graph, each file may go to a different graph specified in a 
         	separate file with the name of the RDF source file plus the extension .graph.</para>
         <para>A .graph file contains the target graph URI without any other content or whitespace.</para>  
         <para>The layout of the load_list table is as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

         <para>On an isql session one may execute rdf_loader_run () &amp; several times, forking a new 
         	isql for each such command, similarly to what a Unix shell does.</para> 
         <para>Because this load is non-transactional and non-logged, one must do an explicit checkpoint

         <para>On a single server do:</para>

<para>To load the uniprot data, create a function for example such as:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create function DB.DBA.UNIPROT_LOAD (in log_mode integer := 1)
{
  DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML_MT (file_to_string_output('filename1'),'http://base_uri_1', 'destination_graph_1', log_mode, 3);
  DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML_MT (file_to_string_output('filename2'),'http://base_uri_2', 'destination_graph_2', log_mode, 3);
  ...
  DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML_MT (file_to_string_output('filename9'),'http://base_uri_9', 'destination_graph_9', log_mode, 3);
}
]]></programlisting>
<para>If you are starting from blank database and you can drop it and re-create in case of error signaled, use it this way:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
checkpoint;
checkpoint_interval(6000);
DB.DBA.UNIPROT_LOAD (0),
checkpoint;
checkpoint_interval(60);
]]></programlisting>
<para>If the database contains important data already and there's no way to stop it and backup before the load then use:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
checkpoint;
checkpoint_interval(6000);
DB.DBA.UNIPROT_LOAD (),
checkpoint;
checkpoint_interval(60);
]]></programlisting>
<para>Note that the 'number of threads' parameter of DB.DBA.RDF_LOAD_RDFXML() mentions threads
used to process data from file, an extra thread will read the text and parse it,
so for 4 CPU cores there's no need in parameter value greater than 3. Three processing
threads per one parsing tread is usually good ratio because parsing is usually three
times faster than the rest of loading so CPU loading is well balanced.
If for example you are using 2 x Quad Xeon, then you can choose between 8
single-threaded parsers or 2 parsers with 3 processing threads each. With 4 cores you may simply load
file after file with 3 processing threads. The most important performance tuning is to set the
[Parameters] section of virtuoso configuration file:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
NumberOfBuffers = 1000000
MaxDirtyBuffers = 800000
MaxCheckpointRemap = 1000000
DefaultIsolation = 2
]]></programlisting>
<para>Note: these numbers are reasonable for 16 GB RAM Linux box. Usually when there are no such massive operations as loading huge database, you can set up the values as:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
NumberOfBuffers = 1500000
MaxDirtyBuffers = 1200000
MaxCheckpointRemap = 1500000
DefaultIsolation = 2

	<title>Tip:</title>
<para>Thus after loading all data you may wish to shutdown, tweak and start server again.
If you have ext2fs or ext3fs filesystem, then it's better to have enough free space on disk not to
make it more than 80% full.  When it's almost full it may allocate database file badly, resulting
in measurable loss of disk access speed. That is not Virtuoso-specific fact, but a common hint
for all database-like applications with random access to big files.</para>
</tip>
<para>Here is an example of using awk file for splitting big file smaller ones:</para>

    <sect2 id="rdfperfsparul"><title>Using SPARUL</title>
	<para>Since SPARUL updates are generally not meant to be transactional, it is
	    best to run these in <link linkend="fn_log_enable"><function>log_enable (2)</function></link> mode,
	    which commits every operation as it is done. This prevents one from running out of rollback space. Also for bulk updates, transaction logging can be turned off. If so, one should do a manual checkpoint after the operation to ensure persistence across server restart since there is no roll forward log.</para>
<para>To have a roll forward log and row by row autocommit, one may use <link linkend="fn_log_enable"><function>log_enable (3)</function></link>. This will write constantly into the log which takes extra time. Having no logging and doing a checkpoint when the whole work is finished is faster.</para>
<para>Many SPARUL operations can be run in parallel in this way. If they are independent with respect to their input and output, they can run in parallel and row by row autocommit will ensure they do not end up waiting for each others' locks.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="rdfperfgeneraldbpedia"><title>DBpedia Benchmark</title>
<para>We ran the DBpedia benchmark queries again with different configurations of Virtuoso.
Comparing numbers given by different parties is a constant problem. In the case reported here,
we loaded the full DBpedia 3, all languages, with about 198M triples, onto Virtuoso v5 and Virtuoso Cluster
v6, all on the same 4 core 2GHz Xeon with 8G RAM. All databases were striped on 6 disks. The Cluster
configuration was with 4 processes in the same box.
We ran the queries in two variants:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>With graph specified in the SPARQL FROM clause, using the default indices.</listitem>
  <listitem>With no graph specified anywhere, using an alternate indexing scheme.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The times below are for the sequence of 5 queries.
As there is a query in the set that specifies no condition on S or O and only P,
thus cannot be done with the default indices With Virtuoso v5. With Virtuoso Cluster v6 it can,
because v6 is more space efficient. So we added the index:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create bitmap index rdf_quad_pogs on rdf_quad (p, o, g, s);
]]></programlisting>
<table>
<tgroup cols="4">
<thead>
<row>
  <entry></entry>
  <entry>Virtuoso v5 with  gspo, ogps, pogs</entry>
  <entry>Virtuoso Cluster v6 with gspo, ogps</entry>
  <entry>Virtuoso Cluster v6 with gspo, ogps, pogs</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>
<row><entry>cold</entry><entry>210 s</entry><entry>136 s</entry><entry>33.4 s</entry></row>
<row><entry>warm</entry><entry>0.600 s</entry><entry>4.01 s</entry><entry>0.628 s</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>
<para>Now let us do it without a graph being specified. Note that alter index is valid for v6 or higher.
For all platforms, we drop any existing indices, and:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create table r2 (g iri_id_8, s, iri_id_8, p iri_id_8, o any, primary key (s, p, o, g))
alter index R2 on R2 partition (s int (0hexffff00));

log_enable (2);
insert into r2 (g, s, p, o) SELECT g, s, p, o from rdf_quad;

drop table rdf_quad;
alter table r2 rename RDF_QUAD;
create bitmap index rdf_quad_opgs on rdf_quad (o, p, g, s) partition (o varchar (-1, 0hexffff));
create bitmap index rdf_quad_pogs on rdf_quad (p, o, g, s) partition (o varchar (-1, 0hexffff));
create bitmap index rdf_quad_gpos on rdf_quad (g, p, o, s) partition (o varchar (-1, 0hexffff));
]]></programlisting>
<para>The code is identical for v5 and v6, except that with v5 we use iri_id (32 bit) for
the type, not iri_id_8 (64 bit). We note that we run out of IDs with v5 around a few billion
triples, so with v6 we have double the ID length and still manage to be vastly more space efficient.</para>
<para>With the above 4 indices, we can query the data pretty much in any combination without hitting
a full scan of any index. We note that all indices that do not begin with s end with s as a bitmap.
This takes about 60% of the space of a non-bitmap index for data such as DBpedia.</para>
<para>If you intend to do completely arbitrary RDF queries in Virtuoso, then chances are
you are best off with the above index scheme.</para>
<table>
<tgroup cols="3">
<thead>
<row>
  <entry></entry>
  <entry>Virtuoso v5 with  gspo, ogps, pogs</entry>
  <entry>Virtuoso Cluster v6 with gspo, ogps, pogs</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>
<row><entry>warm</entry><entry>0.595 s</entry><entry>0.617 s</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>
<para>The cold times were about the same as above, so not reproduced.</para>
<para>It is in the SPARQL spirit to specify a graph and for pretty much any application,
there are entirely sensible ways of keeping the data in graphs and specifying which ones are
concerned by queries. This is why Virtuoso is set up for this by default.</para>
<para>On the other hand, for the open web scenario, dealing with an unknown large number of graphs,
enumerating graphs is not possible and questions like which graph of which source asserts x become
relevant. We have two distinct use cases which warrant different setups of the database, simple as that.</para>
<para>The latter use case is not really within the SPARQL spec, so implementations may or may not
support this.</para>
<para>Once the indices are right, there is no difference between specifying a graph and not specifying a
graph with the queries considered. With more complex queries, specifying a graph or set of graphs does
allow some optimizations that cannot be done with no graph specified. For example, bitmap intersections
are possible only when all leading key parts are given.</para>
<para>The best warm cache time is with v5; the five queries run under 600 ms after the first go.
This is noted to show that all-in-memory with a single thread of execution is hard to beat.</para>
<para>Cluster v6 performs the same queries in 623 ms. What is gained in parallelism is lost in latency
if all operations complete in microseconds. On the other hand, Cluster v6 leaves v5 in the dust in any
situation that has less than 100% hit rate. This is due to actual benefit from parallelism if operations
take longer than a few microseconds, such as in the case of disk reads. Cluster v6 has substantially
better data layout on disk, as well as fewer pages to load for the same content.</para>
<para>This makes it possible to run the queries without the pogs index on Cluster v6 even when v5 takes prohibitively long.</para>
<para>The purpose is to have a lot of RAM and space-efficient data representation.</para>
<para>For reference, the query texts specifying the graph are below. To run without specifying
the graph, just drop the FROM &lt;http://dbpedia.org&gt; from each query. The returned row counts are
indicated below each query's text.</para>

       <para>In a particular RDF Store Benchmarks there is difference if the queries are
executed with specified graph or with specified multiple graphs. As Virtuoso is quad store,
not triple store with many tables, it runs queries inefficiently if graphs are specified
and there are no additional indexes except pre-set GSPO and OGPS. Proper use of the FROM clause
or adding indexes with graph column will contribute for better results.

    <sect3 id="rdfstorebenchmarksindexusage"><title>Using bitmap indexes</title>
    <para>If is known in advance for the current RDF Store Benchmarks that some

    <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>either create indexes with graph in last position</listitem>
       <listitem>or load everything into single graph and specify it somewhere in querying application.</listitem>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>For users using Virtuoso 5 is strongly recommended is the usage of additional bitmap indexes:

  <sect2 id="fastapproxdiffandpatch"><title>Fast Approximate RDF Graph Diff and Patch</title>
<para>Two algorithms described below resemble "unified diff" and "patch by unified diff" 
but they work on RDF graphs, not on plain texts.
</para>
<para>They work reasonably for graphs composed from CBDs (concise bounded descriptions) of 
some subjects, if these subjects are either "named" IRIs or can be identified by values of 
their inverse functional properties.
</para>
<para>Many sorts of commonly used graphs match these restrictions, including all graphs 
without blank nodes, most of FOAF files, graphs that can be "pretty-printed" in JSON, most 
of dumps of relational databases etc.
</para>
<para>The basic idea is as simple as zipper: 
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Place one graph at the left and one to the right,</listitem>
  <listitem>Find a retainer box at the right and a matching pin at the left,</listitem>
  <listitem>Join them</listitem>
  <listitem>Pull the slider as long as possible.</listitem>
  <listitem>Repeat this while there are pins and boxes that can be matched and sliders that can be moved.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>An IRI in left graph <code>(say, G1)</code> matches to same IRI in right graph <code>(G2)</code> 
as pin to box. The same is true for literals too.
</para>
<para>Functional and inverse functional properties are teeth that form chains, algorithm "moves sliders" along these chains, incrementally connecting more and more nodes.
</para>
<para>If there is a match of this sort <code>(O1 in G1 matches O2 in G2)</code> and the matched nodes 
are values of same inverse functional property <code>P</code> (there are <code>{ S1 P O1 }</code> in 
<code>G1</code> and <code>{ S2 P O2 }</code>  in <code>G2</code>) then we guess that <code>S1</code> 
matches <code>S2</code>.
</para>
<para>If <code>S1</code> in <code>G1</code> matches <code>S2</code> in <code>G2</code> and the matched 
nodes are subjects of same functional property <code>P</code> ( there are <code>{ S1 P N1 }</code> in 
<code>G1</code> and <code>{ S2 P N2 }</code> in <code>G2</code> ) then we guess that <code>N1</code> 
matches <code>N2</code>, now it's possible to try same interaction on triples where <code>N1</code> and 
<code>N2</code> are in subject position, that's how slides move. A typical example of a long zipper 
is closed list with matched heads.

<para>Lists of functional properties can be retrieved from an ontology graph by query like:</para>

<para>Inverse functional properties could be retrieved by a similar query, but unfortunately the 
	ontology may mention so called NULL values that can be property values for many subjects. Current 
	implementation of diff and patch does not recognize NULL values so they can cause patch with 
	"false alarm" errors. The workaround is to retrieve only properties that have no NULL values declared:
</para>

<sect3 id="fastapproxdiffandpatchimpl"><title>Implementation-Specific Extensions of GUO Ontology</title>
<para><emphasis>Note</emphasis>: This section contains implementation details that are needed only 
if you want to write your own patch or diff procedure, you don't have to worry about internals if 
you want to use existing procedures.
</para>
<para>Basic GUO ontology is not expressive enough to work with blank nodes, so some custom extensions $
are needed.
</para>
<para>In the rest of the description:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
@prefix guo: <http://webr3.org/owl/guo#>
]]></programlisting>
<para>is assumed.</para>
<para>The diff contains one node of <code>rdf:type guo:diff</code>.
</para>
<para>For debugging purpose it has properties <code>guo:graph1</code> and <code>guo:graph2</code> that 
corespond to <code>gfrom</code> and <code>gto</code> arguments of <link linkend="fn_rdf_suo_diff_ttl">DB.DBA.RDF_SUO_DIFF_TTL</link>.
</para>
<para>The diff also contains zero or more nodes of <code>rdf:type guo:UpdateInstruction</code>. These 
nodes are as described in basic GUO ontology, but <code>guo:target_graph</code> is now optional, 
<code>guo:target_subject</code> can be a blank node and objects of predicates "inside" values of 
<code>guo:insert</code> and <code>guo:delete</code> can also be blank nodes. These blank nodes are 
"placeholders" for values, calculated according to the most important GUO extension - rule nodes.
</para>
<para>There are eight sorts of rule nodes, four for <code>gfrom</code> side of diff and four similar for 
<code>gto</code> side. Out of four sorts related to one side, two are for functional properties and 
two similar are for inverse functional properties. Thus <code>rdf:type-s</code> of these nodes are:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

guo:from-rule-FP1, 
guo:from-rule-IFP0, 
guo:from-rule-IFP1

guo:to-rule-FP0, 
guo:to-rule-FP1, 
guo:to-rule-IFP , 
guo:to-rule-IFP1 .
]]></programlisting>
<para>Each rule node has property <code>guo:order</code> that is an non-negative integer.
</para>
<para>These integers enumerate all <code>guo:from-rule-</code>... nodes, starting from zero.
</para>
<para>When patch procedure works, these rules are used in this order, the result of each rule 
	is a blank node that either exists in the graph or just created.
</para>
<para>All results are remembered for use in the rest of the patch procedure.
</para>
<para>Similarly, other sequence of these integers enumerate all <code>guo:to-rule-</code>... nodes, 
also starting from zero.
</para>
<para>Consider a sequence of <code>guo:from-rule-</code>... nodes, because <code>guo:to-rule-</code> 
nodes have identical properties.
</para>
<para>A rule node can have zero or more values of <code>guo:dep</code> property, each value is a 
bnode that is rule node that should be calculated before the current one.
</para>
<para>Every rule has exactly one predicate <code>guo:path</code> that is a blank node. Each property 
of this blank node describes one possible "move of slider": predicate to follow is in predicate 
position and a node to start from is in object position. An IRI or a literal in object position is 
used as is, a blank node in object position should be of type <code>guo:from-rule-</code>... and 
have smaller <code>guo:order</code> so it refers to already calculated result bnode of some 
preceding rule.

<para>If subjects differ in these triples or some triples are not found or the subject is not a

<para>Current version of patch procedure does not use rules <code>guo:to-rule-</code>...  , 
however they can be used by custom procedure of few sorts. First, these rules can be used to 
produce a "reversed diff". Next, these rules can be used to validate the result of the patch - 
if the patch can not be reverted then the result is "suspicious".

  <sect2 id="rdb2rdftriggers"><title>RDB2RDF Triggers</title>
<para>Linked Data Views have many advantages, if compared to static dumps of the database in RDF triples. 
	However, they does not solve few problems. First, inference is supported only for physically stored 
	triples, so one had to chose between convenience of inference and convenience of Linked Data Views. Next, 
	algorithms that selects triples with non-constant graphs and predicates tend to produce enormous 
	texts of SQL queries if Linked Data Views are complicated enough. Finally, there may be a need in export 
	of big and fresh static RDF dump but preparing this dump would take too much time via both RDF 
	Views and traditional methods.
</para>
<para>The solution is set of triggers on source tables of an Linked Data View that edit parts of physical 
	dump on each change of source data. Unlike Linked Data Views that cost nothing while not queried, these 
	triggers add a significant overhead on any data manipulation on sources, continuously. To 
	compensate this, the dump should be in an intensive use and not replaceable by Linked Data Views. In 
	other cases, do not add these triggers.
</para>
<para>It is next to impossible to write such triggers by hands so a small API is provided to 
	generate SQL texts from metadata of Linked Data Views.

<para>First of all, views in an RDF storage does not work in full isolation from each other. 
	Some of them may partially disable others due to OPTION(EXCLUSIVE) and some may produce one 
	triple in different ways. As a result, triggers are not made on per-view basis. Instead, a 
	special RDF storage is introduced, namely virtrdf:SyncToQuads , all required triples are 
	added to it and triggers are created for the whole storage. Typically an Linked Data View is created 
	in some other storage, e.g., virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage and then added to virtrdf:SyncToQuads via:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
sparql alter quad storage virtrdf:SyncToQuads {
   create <my_rdf_view> using storage virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage };
]]></programlisting>
<para>The following example procedure copies all user-defined Linked Data Views from default quad storage 
	to virtrdf:SyncToQuads:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
create procedure DB.DBA.RDB2RDF_COPY_ALL_RDF_VIEWS_TO_SYNC ()
{
  for (sparql define input:storage ""
    select (bif:aref(bif:sprintf_inverse (str(?idx), bif:concat (str(rdf:_), "%d"), 0), 0)) ?qm
    from virtrdf:
    where { virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage-UserMaps ?idx ?qm . ?qm a virtrdf:QuadMap }
    order by asc (bif:sprintf_inverse (bif:concat (str(rdf:_), "%d"), str (?idx), 1)) ) do
    exec (sprintf ('sparql alter quad storage virtrdf:SyncToQuads { create <%s> using storage virtrdf:DefaultQuadStorage }', "qm"));
}
;
]]></programlisting>
<para>When the virtrdf:SyncToQuads storage is fully prepared, two API functions can be used:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem><link linkend="fn_sparql_rdb2rdf_list_tables">DB.DBA.SPARQL_RDB2RDF_LIST_TABLES</link>: 
  The function returns a vector of names of tables that are used as sources for Linked Data Views. Application 
  developer should decide what to do with each of them - create triggers or do some application-specific 
  workarounds.
  <para>Note that if some SQL views are used as sources for Linked Data Views and these views does not have 
  	INSTEAD triggers then workarounds become mandatory for them, not just a choice, because BEFORE 
  	or AFTER triggers on views are not allowed if there is no appropriate INSTEAD trigger. The mode 
  	argument should be zero in current version.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><link linkend="fn_sparql_rdb2rdf_codegen">DB.DBA.SPARQL_RDB2RDF_CODEGEN</link>: The 
  function creates an SQL text for a given table and an operation specified by an opcode.
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>In some cases, Linked Data Views are complicated enough so that BEFORE UPDATE and AFTER DELETE 
	triggers are required in additional to the minimal set. In this case, sparql_rdb2rdf_codegen 
	calls will return a vector of two string sessions, not single string session, and both sessions 
	are sql texts to inspect or execute. In this case, the BEFORE trigger will not delete obsolete 
	quads from RDF_QUAD table, instead it will create records in a special table RDF_QUAD_DELETE_QUEUE 
	as guesses what can be deleted. The AFTER trigger will re-check these guesses, delete related quads 
	if needed and shorten the RDF_QUAD_DELETE_QUEUE.
</para>
<para>The extra activity of triggers on RDF_QUAD, RDF_OBJ, RDF_QUAD_DELETE_QUEUE and other tables 
	and indexes of the storage of "physical" triples may cause deadlocks so the application should 
	be carefully checked for proper support of deadlocks if they were very seldom before turning 
	RDB2RDF triggers on. In some cases, the whole processing of RDB2RDF can be moved to a separate 
	server and connected to the main workhorse server via replication.
</para>
<para>The following example functions create texts of all triggers, save them to files in for 
	further studying and try to load them. That's probably quite bad scenario for a production 
	database, because it's better to read procedures before loading them, especially if they're 
	triggers, especially if some of them may contain errors.

    <para>Jena is an open source Semantic Web framework for Java. It provides an API to
extract data from and write to RDF graphs. The graphs are represented as an abstract "model".
A model can be sourced with data from files, databases, URIs or a combination of these. A Model
can also be queried through SPARQL and updated through SPARUL.

      <para>Sesame is an open source Java framework for storing, querying and reasoning with RDF and RDF Schema. It can be used as a database for RDF and RDF Schema, or as a Java library for applications that need to work with RDF internally. For example, suppose you need to read a big RDF file, find the relevant information for your application, and use that information. Sesame provides you with the necessary tools to parse, interpret, query and store all this information, embedded in your own application if you want, or, if you prefer, in a separate database or even on a remote server. More generally: Sesame provides an application developer a toolbox that contains useful hammers screwdrivers etc. for doing 'Do-It-Yourself' with RDF.

    <para>The Virtuoso Sesame Provider is a fully operational Native Graph Model Storage Providers for the Sesame Framework, allowing users of Virtuoso to leverage the Sesame framework for modifying, querying, and reasoning with the Virtuoso quad store using the Java language. The Sesame Repository API offers a central access point for connecting to the Virtuoso quad store. Its purpose is to provides a java-friendly access point to Virtuoso. It offers various methods for querying and updating the data, while abstracting the details of the underlying machinery. The Provider has been tested against the <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=46509&amp;package_id=168413">Sesame 2.1.2</ulink> version currently available.

    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartedcrrep"><title>Creating a VirtuosoRepositoryRDF object</title>
      <para>The first step to connecting to Virtuoso through the Sesame API is to create a Repository for it. The Repository object operates on (stacks of) Sail object(s) for storage and retrieval of RDF data.
      </para>
      <para>One of the simplest configurations is a repository that just stores RDF data in main memory without applying any inference or whatsoever. This is also by far the fastest type of repository that can be used. The following code creates and initialize a non-inferencing main-memory repository:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
import virtuoso.sesame2.driver.VirtuosoRepository;

Repository myRepository = VirtuosoRepository("jdbc:virtuoso://localhost:1111,dba,dba);

myRepository.initialize();
]]></programlisting>
      <para>The constructor of the VirtuosoRepository class accepts the JDBC URL of the Virtuoso engine (the default port is 1111), the username and password of an authorized user. Following this example, the repository needs to be initialized to prepare the Sail(s) that it operates on, which includes operations such as restoring previously stored data, setting up connections to a relational database, etc.
      </para>
      <para>The repository that is created by the above code is volatile: its contents are lost when the object is garbage collected or when the program is shut down. This is fine for cases where, for example, the repository is used as a means for manipulating an RDF model in memory.
      </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartedrdfvirtcr"><title>Creating a Virtuoso Repository Connection</title>
      <para>Now that we have created a VirtuosoRepository object instance, we want to do something 
      	with it. This is achieved through the use of the VirtuosoRepositoryConnection class, which 
      	can be created by the VirtuosoRepository class.
      </para>
      <para>A VirtuosoRepositoryConnection represents - as the name suggests - a connection to the 
      	actual Virtuoso quad store. We can issue operations over this connection, and close it when 
      	we are done to make sure we are not keeping resources unnecessarily occupied.
      </para>
      <para>In the following sections, we will show some examples of basic operations using the Northwind dataset.

    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartedrdfvirt"><title>Adding RDF to Virtuoso</title>
      <para>The Repository implements the Sesame Repository API offers various methods for adding data to a repository. Data can be added pro grammatically by specifying the location of a file that contains RDF data, and statements can be added individually or in collections.
      </para>
      <para>We perform operations on the repository by requesting a RepositoryConnection from the 
      	repository, which returns a VirtuosoRepositoryConnection object. On this 
      	VirtuosoRepositoryConnection object we can perform the various operations, such as query 
      	evaluation, getting, adding, or removing statements, etc.

    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartedqr"><title>Querying Virtuoso</title>
      <para>The Repository API has a number of methods for creating and evaluating queries. Three types of queries are distinguished: tuple queries, graph queries and boolean queries. The query types differ in the type of results that they produce.
      </para>
      <para><emphasis>Select Query:</emphasis> The result of a select query is a set of tuples (or 
      variable bindings), where each tuple represents a solution of a query. This type of query is 
      commonly used to get specific values (URIs, blank nodes, literals) from the stored RDF data. 
      The method QueryFactory.executeQuery() returns a Value [ ][ ] for sparql SELECT queries. 
The method QueryFactory.executeQuery() also calls the QueryFactory.setResult() which populates
a set of tuples for SPARQL "SELECT" queries. The graph can be retrieved using
QueryFactory.getBooleanResult().
      </para>
      <para><emphasis>Graph Query:</emphasis> The result of graph queries is an RDF graph (or set of statements). This type of query is very useful for extracting sub-graphs from the stored RDF data, which can then be queried further, serialized to an RDF document, etc. The method QueryFactory.executeQuery() calls the QueryFactory.setGraphResult() which populates a graph for SPARQL DESCRIBE and CONSTRUCT queries. The graph can be retrieved using QueryFactory.getGraphResult().
      </para>
      <para><emphasis>Boolean Query:</emphasis> The result of boolean queries is a simple boolean value, i.e. true of false. This type of query can be used to check if a repository contains specific information. The method QueryFactory.executeQuery() calls the QueryFactory.setBooleanResult() which sets a boolean value for sparql "ASK" queries. The value can be retrieved using QueryFactory.getBooleanResult().
      </para>
      <para>Note: Although Sesame 2 currently supports two query languages: SeRQL and SPARQL, the Virtuoso provider only supports the W3C SPARQL specification. 
      </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartevq"><title>Evaluating a SELECT Query</title>
      <para>To evaluate a tuple query we simply do the following:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
import java.util.List;

import org.openrdf.OpenRDFException;

import org.openrdf.repository.RepositoryConnection;

import org.openrdf.query.TupleQuery;

import org.openrdf.query.TupleQueryResult;

import org.openrdf.query.BindingSet;

import org.openrdf.query.QueryLanguage;

?

try {

   RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();

   try {

      String queryString = "SELECT x, y FROM  WHERE {x} p {y}";

      TupleQuery tupleQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SPARQL, queryString);

      TupleQueryResult result = tupleQuery.evaluate();

      try {

         ? // do something with the result

      }

      finally {

         result.close();

    }

}

   finally {

      con.close();

   }

}

catch (RepositoryException e) {

   // handle exception

}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>This evaluates a SPARQL query and returns a TupleQueryResult, which consists of a sequence 
      	of BindingSet objects. Each BindingSet contains a set of pairs called Binding objects. A 
      	Binding object represents a name/value pair for each variable in the query's projection.
      </para>
      <para>We can use the TupleQueryResult to iterate over all results and get each individual result for x and y:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
while (result.hasNext()) {

   BindingSet bindingSet = result.next();

   Value valueOfX = bindingSet.getValue("x");

   Value valueOfY = bindingSet.getValue("y");

   // do something interesting with the query variable values here?

}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>As you can see, we retrieve values by name rather than by an index. The names used should be the names of variables as specified in your query. The TupleQueryResult.getBindingNames() method returns a list of binding names, in the order in which they were specified in the query. To process the bindings in each binding set in the order specified by the projection, you can do the following:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
List bindingNames = result.getBindingNames();

while (result.hasNext()) {

   BindingSet bindingSet = result.next();

   Value firstValue = bindingSet.getValue(bindingNames.get(0));

   Value secondValue = bindingSet.getValue(bindingNames.get(1));

   // do something interesting with the values here?

}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>It is important to invoke the close() operation on the TupleQueryResult, 
      	after we are done with it. A TupleQueryResult evaluates lazily and keeps resources 
      	(such as connections to the underlying database) open. Closing the TupleQueryResult 
      	frees up these resources. Do not forget that iterating over a result may cause exceptions! 
      	The best way to make sure no connections are kept open unnecessarily is to invoke close() 
      	in the finally clause.
      </para>
      <para>An alternative to producing a TupleQueryResult is to supply an object that implements the 
      	TupleQueryResultHandler interface to the query's evaluate() method. The main difference is 
      	that when using a return object, the caller has control over when the next answer is retrieved, 
      	whereas with the use of a handler, the connection simply pushes answers to the handler object 
      	as soon as it has them available.
      </para>
      <para>As an example we will use SPARQLResultsXMLWriter, which is a TupleQueryResultHandler
implementation that writes SPARQL Results XML documents to an output stream or to a writer:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.query.resultio.sparqlxml.SPARQLResultsXMLWriter;

?

FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/path/to/result.srx");

try {

   SPARQLResultsXMLWriter sparqlWriter = new SPARQLResultsXMLWriter(out);

   RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();

   try {

      String queryString = "SELECT * FROM  WHERE {x} p {y}";

      TupleQuery tupleQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SPARQL, queryString);

      tupleQuery.evaluate(sparqlWriter);

   }

   finally {

      con.close();

   }

}

finally {

   out.close();

}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>You can just as easily supply your own application-specific implementation of TupleQueryResultHandler though.
      </para>
      <para>Lastly, an important warning: as soon as you are done with the RepositoryConnection
object, you should close it. Notice that during processing of the TupleQueryResult object
      	(for example, when iterating over its contents), the RepositoryConnection should still be 
      	open. We can invoke con.close() after we have finished with the result. 
      </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamegettingstartevcnq"><title>Evaluating a CONSTRUCT query</title>
      <para>The following code evaluates a graph query on a repository:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.query.GraphQueryResult;

GraphQueryResult graphResult = con.prepareGraphQuery(

      QueryLanguage.SPARQL, "CONSTRUCT * FROM {x} p {y}").evaluate();
]]></programlisting>
      <para> A GraphQueryResult is similar to TupleQueryResult in that is an object that 
      	iterates over the query results. However, for graph queries the query results are RDF 
      	statements, so a GraphQueryResult iterates over Statement objects:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
while (graphResult.hasNext()) {

   Statement st = graphResult.next();

   // ? do something with the resulting statement here.


}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>The TupleQueryResultHandler equivalent for graph queries is org.openrdf.rio.RDFHandler.
      	Again, this is a generic interface, each object implementing it can process the reported RDF 
      	statements in any way it wants.
      </para>
      <para>All writers from Rio (such as the RDFXMLWriter, TurtleWriter, TriXWriter, etc.) implement
      	the RDFHandler interface. This allows them to be used in combination with querying quite easily. 
      	In the following example, we use a TurtleWriter to write the result of a SPARQL graph query to 
      	standard output in Turtle format:
      </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.rio.turtle.TurtleWriter;

?

RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();

try {

   TurtleWriter turtleWriter = new TurtleWriter(System.out);

   con.prepareGraphQuery(QueryLanguage.SPARQL, "CONSTRUCT * FROM  WHERE {x} p {y}").evaluate(turtleWriter);

    }

finally {

   con.close();

}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>Again, note that as soon as we are done with the result of the query (either after iterating over the contents of the GraphQueryResult? or after invoking the RDFHandler), we invoke con.close() to close the connection and free resources.

<para>Sesame is an open source Java framework for storing, querying and reasoning with RDF and RDF Schema. It can be used as a
database for RDF and RDF Schema, or as a Java library for applications that need to work with RDF internally. The Sesame HTTP
repository serves as a proxy for a RDF store hosted on a remote Sesame server, enabling the querying of the RDF store using
the Sesame HTTP protocol.
</para>
      </sect4>
      <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamestpandtestingwhy"><title>Why</title>
<para>The Sesame HTTP repository endpoint provides users with the greater flexibility for manipulating the RDF store via a common
interface. Sesame provides you with the necessary tools to parse, interpret, query and store all this information, embedded
in your own application if you want, or, if you prefer, in a separate database or even on a remote server.
</para>
      </sect4>
      <sect4 id="rdfnativestorageproviderssesamestpandtestinghow"><title>How</title>
<para>To create a new Sesame HTTP repository, the Console needs to create such an RDF document and submit it to the SYSTEM
repository. The Console uses so called repository configuration templates to accomplish this. Repository configuration templates
are simple Turtle RDF files that describe a repository configuration, where some of the parameters are replaced with variables.
The Console parses these templates and asks the user to supply values for the variables. The variables are then substituted with
the specified values, which produces the required configuration data.

  <listitem>Conversely the Sesame HTTP repository can be configured to access the repository created by the Sesame console.
To do this the location of the data directory for both needs to be reconfigured using the Java system property
info.aduna.platform.appdata.basedir (does not include "OpenRDF Sesame console directory) to point to the same location.
When you are using Tomcat as the servlet container then you can set this property using the JAVA_OPTS parameter.
Note, if you are using Apache Tomcat as a Windows Service you should use the Windows Services configuration tool to
set this property. Other users can either edit the Tomcat startup script or set the property some other way.

     <para><ulink url="http://librdf.org/">Redland</ulink> is a set of free software 'C' libraries that
provide support for the Resource Description Framework (RDF), providing modular, object based libraries
and APIs for manipulating the RDF graph, triples, URIs and Literals. Redland includes several high-level
language APIs providing RDF manipulation and storage and requires the
<ulink url="http://librdf.org/raptor/">Raptor</ulink> RDF parser and <ulink url="http://librdf.org/rasqal/">Rasqal</ulink>
RDF syntax and query library
for its use.

    <sect3 id="rdfnativestorageproviderredlandwhatisv"><title>What is the Virtuoso Redland Provider</title>
    <para>The Virtuoso Redland RDF Provider is an implementation of the Storage API, Model and Query
interfaces of the Redland framework for RDF. This provider enables the execution of queries via the
Redland Rasqal query engine or via Virtuoso query engine directly against the Virtuoso Quad store.
The Virtuoso Redland Provider uses ODBC as the data access mechanism for communicating the Virtuoso
Quad Store and requires the Virtuoso ODBC Driver be installed on the Redland client and a suitable
ODBC DSN be configured for connecting to the target Virtuoso Quad Store instance. The provider has
been tested against the <ulink url="http://download.librdf.org/source/">Redland 1.0.8</ulink> version currently available for download.

    <para>As indicated in the above diagram the Virtuoso Provider can be used to execute RDF queries either
directly against the Virtuoso graph storage module supporting the <ulink url="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SPARQL">SPARQL</ulink>,
<ulink url="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SPARUL">SPARQL</ulink>SPARUL, <ulink url="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VOSArticleBISPARQL2">SPARQL-BI</ulink>
query languages or via the Rasqal query engine built into Redland which supports the SPARQL query language.
This is done by simply changing the syntax of the query using the "vsparql" rather then default "sparql"
construct when executing a query as indicated in the sample queries below:
    </para>

        <para>NOTE: Take care exposing the password as for example, program arguments or environment
variables. The rdfproc utility can help this by reading the password from standard input. Inside programs,
one way to prevent storing the password in a string is to construct a Redland hash of the storage options
such as via librdf hash_from_string and use librdf_new_storage_with_options to create a storage. The
rdfproc utility source code demonstrates this.
        </para>
        <para>The storage name parameter given to the storage constructor librdf new_storage is used
inside the virtuoso store to allow multiple stores inside one Virtuoso database instance as parameterized
with the above options.

      <para>In this section we will examine a proposed setup for a back-end server called MASTER which 
      	publishes a number of graphs to a set of front-end machines called FARM-1 .. FARM-n and discuss 
      	a couple of common scenarios like adding an extra machine to the farm, or replacing a broken 
      	instance of MASTER.</para>    
      <para>In this example we will assume each virtuoso instance running on its own machine, so they can 
      	use the same port numbers for both the main server (default 1111) as well as the http port 
      	(default 8890) as each machine has an unique IP addresses. In the example we use MASTER-IP and 
      	FARM-x-IP which should be replaced by either the real IP address or the DNS name of the machine 
      	in question.</para>      
      <para>Since there will be a reverse-proxy service in front of the farm, all virtuoso instances 
      	should have the URIQA Default host set to the outside name for this service. In this example 
      	we will use http://test.example.com as the web service we are trying to setup.</para>
