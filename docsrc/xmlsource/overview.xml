    <title>What is Virtuoso?</title>
    <para>OpenLink Virtuoso is the first CROSS PLATFORM Universal Server to
		implement Web, File, and Database server functionality alongside Native XML
		Storage, and Universal Data Access Middleware, as a single server solution.
		It includes support for key Internet, Web, and Data Access standards such
		as: XML, XPATH, XSLT, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, WebDAV, SMTP, SQL-92, ODBC, JDBC,
		and OLE-DB. Virtuoso currently supports the following Operating systems -
		Windows 95/98/NT/2000, Linux (Intel, Alpha, Mips, PPC), Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
		Unixware, IRIX, Digital UNIX, DYNIX/PTX, FreeBSD, SCO, MacOS X.</para>
    <para>Virtuoso is a revolutionary, next generation, high-performance virtual database engine
    for the Distributed Computing Age. It is a core universal data access technology set to
    accelerate our advances into the emerging Information Age.</para>
    <para>Virtuoso provides transparent access to your existing data sources, which are typically
    databases from different database vendors.</para>
    <para>Through a single connection, Virtuoso will simultaneously connect your ODBC, JDBC,
    UDBC, OLE-DB client applications and services to data within Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server,
    DB/2, Informix, Progress, CA-Ingres and other ODBC compliant database engines. All your
    databases are treated as single logical unit.</para>
    <para>The diagram below depicts how applications that are built in conformance with industry
    standards (such as ODBC, JDBC, UDBC, and OLE-DB) only need to make a single connection via
    Virtuoso&apos;s Virtual Database Engine and end up with concurrent and real-time access to data
    within different database types.</para>
		<para>Further still, Virtuoso exposes all of its functionality to Web Services.
		This means that your existing infrastructure can be used support Web Services
		directly without any hint of replacement.

    <title>Why Do I Need Virtuoso?</title>
    <para>You need Virtuoso because Knowledge is power or competitive advantage (depending on how
    you choose to exploit it). All Knowledge comes from Information. Information is produced
    from Data. </para>
    <para>The Internet is reducing the cost of accessing Information, thereby increasing the
    appetite and rates at which Information is produced and consumed. Unfortunately data
    required for the production of Information simply does not reside within one database
    engine within your organization. </para>
    <para>Whether you know it or not it is highly probable that the quest for critical
    information within your organization actually requires traversing several data sources
    served by numerous database engines from different database vendors.</para>
    <para>Virtuoso simply reduces the cost of bringing together data from different data sources
    with the view to accelerating the production of information by your Query Tools, Web &amp;
    Internet Application Development Environments, Traditional Application Development Tools,
    and Desktop Productivity Tools.</para>
    <para>Virtuoso enables you to compete effectively in the Information Age.</para>

	  <para>One of the biggest challenges facing the uptake of XML is the
		availability of key XML Data itself. Virtuoso simplifies the process of
		creating XML data from existing HTML, syndicated XML, and SQL databases.
		Virtuoso enables real-time creation of Dynamic XML documents (DTD or
		XML Schema based) from homogeneous or heterogeneous SQL Databases "on the fly".</para>
		<para>By implementing a number of protocols in a single server solution,
		Virtuoso provides you with a unifying foundation upon which next generation
		eBusiness solutions can be developed and deployed. Virtuoso reduces the cost
		of bringing together data from different data sources and leverages this
		into increased effectiveness of your Query Tools, Web &amp; Internet Application
		Development Environments, Traditional Application Development Tools, and
		Desktop Productivity Tools. Virtuoso enables you compete effectively in the
		Information Age.</para>

          <title>Virtuoso 6 FAQ</title>
<para>We have received various inquiries on high-end metadata stores. We will here go through some salient
questions. The requested features include:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Scaling to trillions of triples</listitem>
  <listitem>Running on clusters of commodity servers</listitem>
  <listitem>Running in federated environments, possibly over wide-area networks</listitem>
  <listitem>Built-in inference</listitem>
  <listitem>Transactions</listitem>
  <listitem>Security</listitem>
  <listitem>Support for extra triple level metadata, such as security attributes</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
    <para><emphasis>Questions:</emphasis></para>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq1"><title>What is the storage cost per triple?</title>
<para>This depends on the index scheme. If indexed 2 ways, assuming that the graph will
always be stated in queries, this is 31 bytes.</para>
<para>With 4 indices, supporting queries where the graph can be left unspecified (i.e., triples from
any graph will be considered in query evaluation), this is 39 bytes. The numbers are measured with
the LUBM validation data set of 121K triples, with no full-text index on literals.</para>
<para>With 4 indices and a full text index on all literals, the Billion Triples Challenge data set,
1115M triples, is about 120 GB of database pages. The database file size is larger due to space in
reserve and other factors. 120 GB is the number to use when assessing RAM-to-disk ratio, i.e., how
much RAM the system ought to have in order to provide good response. This data set is a heterogeneous
collection including social network data, conversations harvested from the Web, DBpedia, Freebase,
etc., with relatively numerous and long text literals.</para>
<para>The numbers do not involve any database page stream compression such as gzip. Using such
compression does not save in terms of RAM because cached pages must be kept uncompressed but
will cut the disk usage to about half.</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq2"><title>What is the cost to insert a triple (for the insertion
itself, as well as for updating any indices)?</title>
<para>The more triples are inserted at a time, the faster this goes. Also, the more concurrent
triple insertions are going on, the better the throughput. When loading data such as the US Census,
a cluster of 2 commodity servers can insert up to 100,000 triples per second.</para>
<para>A single 4-core machine can load 1 billion triples of LUBM data at an average rate
of 36K triples per second. This is limited by disk.</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq3"><title>What is the cost to delete a triple (for the deletion
itself, as well as for updating any indices)?</title>
<para>
The delete cost is similar to insert cost.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq4"><title>What is the cost to search on a given property?</title>
<para>If we are looking for equality matches, a single 2GHz core can do about 250,000 single triple
random lookups per second as long as disk reads are not involved. If each triple requires a disk
seek the number is naturally lower.
</para>
<para>Parallelism depends on the query. With a query like counting all x and y such that x knows
y and y knows x, we get up to 3.4 million single-triple lookups-per-second on a cluster of 2 8-core
Xeon servers. With complex nested sub-queries the parallelism may be less.
</para>
<para>Lookups involving ranges of values, such as ranges of geographical coordinates or dates use
an index, since quads are indexed in a manner that collates in the natural order of the data type.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq5"><title>What data types are supported?</title>
<para>Virtuoso supports all RDF data types, including language-tagged and XML schema typed strings
as native data types. Thus there is no overhead converting between RDF data types and types
supported by the underlying DBMS.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq6"><title>What inferencing is supported?</title>
<para>Subclass, subproperty, identity by inverse-functional properties, and owl:sameAs are
processed at run time if an inference context option is specified in the query.
</para>
<para>There is a general-purpose transitivity feature that can be used for a
wide variety of graph algorithms. For example:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT ?friend
WHERE
  {
    <alice> foaf:knows ?friend option (transitive)
  }
]]></programlisting>
<para>would return all the people directly or indirectly known by &lt;alice&gt;.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq7"><title>Is the inferencing dynamic, or is an extra
step required before inferencing can be used?</title>
<para>The mentioned types of inferencing are enabled by a switch in the query and are done at
run-time, with no step for materialization of entailed triples needed. The pattern:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{?s a <type>}
]]></programlisting>
<para>would iterate over all the RDFS subclasses of &lt;type&gt; and look for subjects with this type.
</para>
<para>The pattern:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{<thing> a ?class}
]]></programlisting>
<para>will, if the match of ?class has superclasses, also return the superclasses even though the
superclass membership is not physically stored for each superclass.
</para>
<para>Of course, one can always materialize entailed triples by running SPARQL/SPARUL statements
to explicitly add any implied information.
</para>
<para>If two subjects have the same inverse functional property with the same value, they will be
considered the same. For example, if two people have the same email address, they will be
considered the same.
</para>
<para>If two subjects are declared to be owl:sameAs, either directly or through a chain of x owl:sameAs
y, y owl:sameAs z, and so on, they will be considered the same.
</para>
<para>These features can be individually enabled and disabled. They all have some run time cost, hence
they are optional. The advantage is that no preprocessing of the data itself is needed before querying,
and the data does not get bigger. This is important, especially if the database is very large and
queries touch only small parts of it. In such cases, materializing implied triples can be very costly.
See discussion at <ulink url="http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/?id=1498">E Pluribus Unum</ulink>
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq8"><title>Do you support full-text search?</title>
<para>Virtuoso has an optional full-text index on RDF literals. Searching for text matches using
the SPARQL regex feature is very inefficient in the best of cases. This is why Virtuoso offers a special
<emphasis>bif:contains</emphasis> predicate similar to the SQL <emphasis>contains</emphasis> predicate
of many relational databases. This supports a full-text query language with proximity, and/or/and-not,
wildcards, etc.
</para>
<para>While the full-text index is a general-purpose SQL feature in Virtuoso, there is extra RDF-specific
intelligence built into it. One can, for example, specify which properties are indexed, and within which
graphs this applies.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq9"><title>What programming interfaces are supported? Do you
support standard SPARQL protocol?</title>
<para>Virtuoso supports the standard SPARQL protocol.
</para>
<para>Virtuoso offers drivers for the Jena, Sesame, and Redland frameworks. These allow using
Virtuoso's store and SPARQL implementation as the back end of Jena, Sesame, or Redland applications.
Virtuoso will then do the query optimization and execution. Jena and Sesame drivers come standard;
contact us about Redland.
</para>
<para>Virtuoso SPARQL can be used through any SQL call level interface (CLI) supported by Virtuoso
(i.e., ODBC, JDBC, OLE-DB, ADO.NET, XMLA). All have suitable extensions for RDF specific data types
such as IRIs and typed literals. In this way, one can write, for example, PHP web pages with SPARQL
queries embedded, just using the SQL tools. Prefixing a SQL query with the keyword "sparql" will
invoke SPARQL instead of SQL, through any SQL client API.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq10"><title>How can data be partitioned across multiple servers?</title>
<para>
Virtuoso Cluster partitions each index of all tables containing RDF data separately. The partitioning is by
hash. The result is that the data is evenly distributed over the selected number of servers. Immediately
consecutive triples are generally in the same partition, since the low bits of IDs do not enter in into
the partition hash. This means that key compression works well.
</para>
<para>
Since RDF tables are in the end just SQL tables, SQL can be used for specifying a non-standard
partitioning scheme. For example, one could dedicate one set of servers for one index, and
another set for another index. Special cases might justify doing this.
</para>
<para>
With very large deployments, using a degree of application-specific data structures may be advisable.
See "Does Virtuoso support property tables".
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq11"><title>How many triples can a single server handle?</title>
<para>
With free-form data and text indexing enabled, 500M triples per 16G RAM can be a ballpark guideline.
If the triples are very short and repetitive, like the LUBM test data, then 16G per one billion
triples is a possibility. Much depends on the expected query load. If queries are simple lookups,
then less memory per billion triples is needed. If queries will be complex (analytics, join sequences,
and aggregations all over the data set), then relatively more RAM is necessary for good performance.
</para>
<para>
The count of quads has little impact on performance as long as the working set fits in memory. If
the working set is in memory, there may be 15-20% difference between a million and a billion triples.
If the database must frequently go to disk, this degrades performance since one can easily do 2000
random accesses in memory in the time it takes to do one random access from disk. But working-set
characteristics depend entirely on the application.
</para>
<para>
Whether the quads in a store all belong to one graph or any number of graphs makes no difference.
There are Virtuoso instances in regular online use with hundreds of millions of triples, such as
DBpedia and the <ulink url="http://neurocommons.org/page/Main_Page">Neurocommons</ulink> databases.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq12"><title>What is the performance impact of going from the
billion to the trillion triples?</title>
<para>
Performance dynamics change when going from a single server to a cluster. If each partition is around a
billion triples in size, then the single triple lookup takes the same time, but there is cluster
interconnect latency added to the mix.
</para>
<para>
On the other hand, queries that touch multiple partitions or multiple triples in a partition will do
this in parallel and usually with a single message per partition. Thus throughput is higher.
</para>
<para>
In general terms, operations on a single triple at a time from a single thread are penalized and
operations on hundreds or more triples at a time win. Multiuser throughput is generally better
due to more cores and more memory, and latency is absorbed by having large numbers of concurrent requests.
</para>
<para>
See <ulink url="http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/?id=1487">a sample of SPARQL scalability</ulink>.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq13"><title>Do you support additional metadata for triples,
such as time-stamps, security tags etc?</title>
<para>
Since quads (triple plus graph) are stored in a regular SQL table with special data types, changing the
table layout to add a column is possible. This column would not however be visible to SPARQL without
some extra tuning. For coarse grain provenance and security information, we recommend doing this at
the graph level, where triples that belong together are tagged with the same provenance or security
are in the same graph. The graph can then have the relevant metadata as its properties.
</para>
<para>
If tagging at the single triple level is needed, this will most often not be needed for all triples.
Hence altering the table for all triples may not be the best choice. Making a special table that
has the graph, subject, predicate and object of the tagged triple as a key and the tag data as a
dependent part may be more efficient. Also, this table could be more easily accessed from SPARQL.
</para>
<para>
Using the RDF reification vocabulary is not recommended as a first choice but is possible without
any alterations.
</para>
<para>
Alterations of this nature are possible but we recommend contacting us for specifics. We can
provide consultancy on the best way to do this for each application. Altering the storage layout
without some extra support from us is not recommended.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq14"><title>Should we use RDF for our large metadata store?
What are the alternatives?</title>
<para>
If the application has high heterogeneity of schema and frequent need for adaptation, then RDF is
recommended. The alternative is making a relational database.
</para>
<para>
Making a custom non-RDF object-attribute-value representation on Virtuoso or some other RDBMS is
possible but not recommended.
</para>
<para>
The reason for this is that this would miss many of the optimizations made specifically for RDF,
use of the SPARQL language, inference, compatibility with diverse browsers and front end tools,
etc. Not to mention interoperability and joinability with the body of linked data. Even if the
application is strictly private, using entity names and ontologies from the open world can still
have advantages.
</para>
<para>
If some customization to the quad (triple plus graph layout) is needed, we can provide consultancy
on how to do this while staying within the general RDF framework and retaining all the interoperability
benefits.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq15"><title>How multithreaded is Virtuoso?</title>
<para>
All server and client components are multithreaded, using pthreads on Unix/Linux, Windows native on
Windows. Multithread/multicore scalability is good; see
<ulink url="http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/?id=1409">BSBM</ulink>
</para>
<para>
In the case of Virtuoso Cluster, in order to have the maximum number of threads on a single query,
we recommend that each server on the cluster be running one Virtuoso process per 1.2 cores.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq16"><title>Can multiple servers run off a single shared disk
database?</title>
<para>This might be possible with some customization but this is not our preferred way. Instead, we can
store selected indices in duplicate or more copies inside a clustered database. In this way, all
servers can have their own disk. Each key of each index will belong to one partition but each
partition will have more than one physical copy, each on a different server. The cluster query
logic will perform the load balancing. On the update side, the cluster will automatically do a
distributed transaction with two phase commit to keep the duplicates in sync.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq17"><title>Can Virtuoso run on a SAN?</title>
<para>
Yes. Unlike Oracle RAC, for example, Virtuoso Cluster does not require a SAN. Each server has its
own database files and is solely responsible for these. In this way, having shared disk among all
servers is not required. Running on a SAN may still be desirable for administration reasons. If
using a SAN, the connection to the SAN should be high performance, such as Infiniband.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq18"><title>How does Virtuoso join across partitions?</title>
<para>
Partitioning is entirely transparent to the application. Virtuoso has a highly optimized
message-flow between cluster nodes that combines operations into large batches and evaluates
conditions close to the data. See a sample of RDF scaling.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq19"><title>Does Virtuoso support federated triple stores? If
there are multiple SPARQL end points, can Virtuoso be used to do queries joining between these?</title>
<para>
This is a planned extension. The logic for optimizing message flow between multiple end-points on
a wide-area network is similar to the logic for message-optimization on a cluster. This will
allow submitting a query with a list of end-points. The query will then consider triples from
each of the end points, as if the content of all the end points were in a single store.
</para>
<para>
End-point meta information, such as voiD descriptions of the graphs in the end-points, may be
used to avoid sending queries to end points that are known not to have a certain type of data.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq20"><title>How many servers can a cluster contain?</title>
<para>
There is no fixed limit. If you have a large cluster installed, you can try Virtuoso there.
Having an even point-to-point latency is desirable.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq21"><title>How do I reconfigure a cluster, adding and
removing machines, etc?</title>
<para>
We are working on a system whereby servers can be added and removed from a cluster during
operation and no repartitioning of the data is needed.
</para>
<para>
In the first release, the number of server processes that make up the cluster is set when
creating the database. These processes with their database files can then be moved between
machines but this requires stopping the cluster and updating configuration files.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq22"><title>How will Virtuoso handle regional clusters?</title>
<para>
Performance of a cluster depends on the latency and bandwidth of the interconnect. At least dual
1Gbit ethernet is recommended for each node. Thus a cluster should be on a single local or system
area network.
</para>
<para>
If regional copies are needed, we would replicate between clusters by asynchronous log shipping.
This requires some custom engineering.
</para>
<para>
When a transaction is committed at one site, it is logged and sent to the subscribing sites if
they are online. If there is no connection, the subscribing sites will get the data from the log.
This scheme now works between single Virtuoso servers, and needs some custom development to be
adapted to clusters.
</para>
<para>
If replicating all the data of one site to another site is not possible, then application logic
should be involved. Also, if consolidated queries should be made against large,
geographically-separated clusters, then it is best to query them separately and merge the
results in the application. All depends on the application level rules on where data resides.
</para>

           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq23"><title>Is there a mechanism for terminating long running queries?</title>
<para>
Virtuoso SPARQL and SQL offer an "anytime" option that will return partial results after a configurable
timeout.
</para>
<para>
In this way, queries will return in a predictable time and indicate whether the results are complete
or not, as well as give a summary of resource utilization.
</para>
<para>
This is especially useful for publishing a SPARQL endpoint where a single long running query could
impact the performance of the whole system. This timeout significantly reduces the risk of denial
of service.
</para>
<para>
This is also more user-friendly than simply timing-out a query after a set period and returning
an error. With the anytime option, the user gets a feel for what data may exist, including whether
any data exists at all. This feature works with arbitrarily complex queries, including aggregation,
GROUP BY, ORDER BY, transitivity, etc.
</para>
<para>
Since the Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint supports open authentication (OAuth), the authentication can be
used for setting timeouts, so as to give different service to different users.
</para>
<para>
It is also possible to set a timeout that will simply abort a query or an update transaction if it
fails to terminate in a set time.
</para>
<para>
Disconnecting the client from the server will also terminate any processing on behalf of that client,
regardless of timeout settings.
</para>
<para>
The SQL client call-level interfaces (ODBC, JDBC, OLE-DB, ADO.NET, XMLA) each support a cancel call
that can terminate a long running query from the application, without needing to disconnect.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq24"><title>Can the user be asynchronously notified when a
long running query terminates?</title>
<para>
There is no off-the-shelf API for this but making an adaptation of the SPARQL endpoint that
could proceed after the client disconnected and, for example, could send results by email is
trivial. Since SOAP and REST Web services can be programmed directly in Virtuoso's stored
procedure language, implementing and exposing this type of application logic is easy.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq25"><title>How many concurrent queries can Virtuoso handle?</title>
<para>
There is no set limit. As with any DBMS, response times get longer if there is severe congestion.
</para>
<para>
For example, having 2 or 3 concurrent queries per core is a good performance point which will keep
all parts of the system busy. Having more than this is possible but will not increase overall throughput.
</para>
<para>
With a cluster, each server has both HTTP and SQL listeners, so clients can be evenly spread across
all nodes. In a heavy traffic Web application, it is best to have a load balancer in front of the
HTTP endpoints to divide the connections among the servers and to keep some cap on the number of
concurrently running requests, enforcing a maximum request-rate per client IP address, etc.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq26"><title>What is the relative performance of SPARQL queries
vs native relational queries?</title>
<para>
This is application dependent. In Virtuoso, SPARQL and SQL share the same query execution engine,
query optimizer, and cost model. If data is highly regular (i.e., a good fit for relational
representation), and if queries typically access most of the row, then SQL will be more efficient.
If queries are unpredictable, data is ragged, schema changes frequent, or inference is needed,
then RDF will do relatively better.
</para>
<para>
The recent Berlin SPARQL Benchmark shows some figures comparing Virtuoso SQL and SPARQL and SPARQL
in front of relational representation. However, the test workload is heavily biased in favor of
relational. See also BSBM: MySQL vs Virtuoso.
</para>
<para>
With the TPC-H workload, relationally stored data, and SPARQL mapped to SQL, we find that with about
half the queries there is no significant cost to SPARQL. With some queries there is additional
overhead because the mapping does not produce a SQL query identical to that specified in the benchmark.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq27"><title>Does Virtuoso Support Property Tables?</title>
<para>
For large applications, we would recommend RDF whenever there is significant variability of schema, but
would still use an application-specific, relational style representation for those parts of the data
that are regular in format. This is possible without loss of flexibility for the variable-schema part.
However, this will introduce relational-style restrictions on the regular data; for example, a person
could only have a single date-of-birth by design. In many cases, such restrictions are quite acceptable.
Querying will still take place in SPARQL, and the representation will be transparent.
</para>
<para>
A relational table where the primary key is the RDF subject and where columns represent single-valued
properties is usually called a property table. These can be defined in a manner similar to defining RDF
mappings of relational tables.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq28"><title>What performance metrics does Virtuoso offer?</title>
<para>There is an extensive array of performance metrics. This includes:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Cluster status summary with thread counts, CPU utilization, interconnect traffic, clean and
dirty cache pages, virtual memory swapping warning, etc. This is either a cluster total or a total with
breakdown per cluster node.</listitem>
  <listitem>Disk access, lock contention, general concurrency, and access count per index </listitem>
  <listitem>Statistics on memory usage for disk caching index-by-index, cache replacement statistics, disk
random and sequential read times</listitem>
  <listitem>Count of random, sequential index access, disk access, lock contention, cluster interconnect
traffic per query/client </listitem>
  <listitem>Detailed query-execution plans are available through the
<link linkend=""><function>explain</function></link> function</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq29"><title>What support do you provide for concurrent/multithreaded
operation? Is your interface thread-safe?</title>
<para>
All client interfaces and server-side processes are multithreaded. As usual, each thread of an application
should use a different connection to the database.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq30"><title>What level of ACID properties is supported?</title>
<para>
Virtuoso supports all 4 isolation levels from dirty read to serializable, for both relational and RDF data.
</para>
<para>
The recommended default isolation is read-committed, which offers a clean historical read of data that has
uncommitted updates. This mode is similar to the Oracle default isolation and guarantees that no uncommitted
data is seen, and that no read will block waiting for a lock held by another client.
</para>
<para>
There is transaction logging and roll forward recovery, with two phase commit used in Virtuoso Cluster
if an update transaction modifies more than one server.
</para>
<para>
For RDF workloads which typically are not transactional and have large bulk loads, we recommend running
in a "row autocommit" mode without transaction logging. This virtually eliminates log contention but
still guarantees consistent results of multithreaded bulk loads.
</para>
<para>
Setting this up requires some consultancy and custom development but is well worthwhile for large projects.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq31"><title>Do you provide the ability to atomically add a set of
triples, where either all are added or none are added?</title>
<para>
Yes. Doing this with millions of triples per transaction may run out of rollback space. Also,
there is risk of deadlock if multiple such inserts run at the same time. For good concurrency,
the inserts should be of moderate size. As usual, deadlocks are resolved by aborting one of the
conflicting transactions.
</para>
	   </sect2>
          <sect2 id="virtuosofaq32"><title>Do you provide the ability to add a set of triples,
respecting the isolation property (so concurrent accessors either see none of the triple values,
or all of them)?</title>
<para>Yes. The reading client should specify serializable isolation and the inserting client should
perform the insert as a transaction, no row autocommit mode.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq33"><title>What is the time to start a database, create/open a graph?</title>
<para>
Starting a Virtuoso server process takes a few seconds. Making a new graph takes no time beyond the
time to insert the triples into it. Once the server process(es) are running, all the data is online.
</para>
<para>
With high-traffic applications, reaching cruising speed may sometimes take a long time, specially if
the load is random-access intensive. Filling gigabytes of RAM with cached disk pages takes a long
time if done a page at a time. To alleviate this, Virtuoso pre-reads 2MB-sized extents instead of
single pages if there is repeated access to the same extent within a short time. Thus cache warm-up
times are shortened.
</para>
	   </sect2>
           <sect2 id="virtuosofaq33"><title>What sort of security features are built into Virtuoso?</title>
<para>
For SQL, we have the standard role-based security and an Oracle-style row-level security (policy) feature.
</para>
<para>
For SPARQL, users may have read or update roles at the level of the quad store.
</para>
<para>
With RDF, a graph may be owned by a user. The user may specify read and write privileges on the graph.
These are then enforced for SPARUL (the SPARQL update language) and SPARQL.
</para>
<para>
When an RDF graph is based on relationally stored data in Virtuoso or another RDBMS through Virtuoso's
SQL federation feature (i.e., if the graph is an Linked Data View of underlying SQL data), then all relational
security controls apply.
</para>
<para>
Further, due to the dual-nature of Virtuoso, sophisticated ontology-based security models are feasible.
Such models are not currently used by default, but they are achievable with our consultancy.

      <title>How Can I Control the normalization of UNICODE3 accented chars in free-text index?</title>                    
<para>
The normalization of UNICODE3 accented chars in free-text index can be controlled by setting up the 
configuration parameter <emphasis>XAnyNormalization</emphasis> in the
virtuoso.ini config file, section [I18N]. This parameter controls whether accented
UNICODE characters should be converted to their non-accented base
variants at the very beginning of free-text indexing or parsing a
free-text query string. The parameter's value is an integer that is bitmask with
only 2 bits in use atm:
</para>
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>0: the default behavior, do not normalize anything, so "Jose" and
"José" are two distinct words.
</listitem>
  <listitem>2: Any combined char is converted to its (smallest known) base. So
"é" will lose its accent and become plain old ASCII "e".</listitem>
  <listitem>3: This is equl to 1|2 and when set then performs both conversions. 
As a result, pair of base char and combinig char loses its second char and chars with accents will lose
accents.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
     <para>If the parameter is required at all, the needed value is probably 3. So
the fragment of virtuoso.ini is:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[I18N]
XAnyNormalization=3
]]></programlisting>
     <para>In some seldom case the value of 1 can be appropriate. The parameter
should be set once before creating the database. If changed on the
existing database, all free-text indexes that may contain non-ASCII data
should be re-created. On a typical system, the parameter affects all
text columns, XML columns, RDF literals and queries.</para>
<para>Strictly speaking, it affects not all of them but only items that use
default "x-any" language or language derived from x-any such as "en" and
"en-US" but if you haven't tried writing new C plugins for custom
languages you should not look so deep.</para>
     <para>As an example, with <emphasis>XAnyNormalization=3</emphasis> once can get the following:</para>

      <para>The best method to get a random sample of all triples for a subset of all the resources of 
      	a SPARQL endpoint, is decimation in its original style:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[ 
SELECT ?s ?p ?o 
FROM <some-graph>
WHERE 
  { 
    ?s ?p ?o .
    FILTER ( 1 > bif:rnd (10, ?s, ?p, ?o) )
  }
]]></programlisting>   	
      <para>By tweaking first argument of <emphasis>bif:rnd()</emphasis> and the left side of the 
      inequality you can tweak decimation ratio from 1/10 to the desired value. What's important is 
      to know that the SQL optimizer has a right to execute <emphasis>bif:rnd (10)</emphasis> only once 
      at the beginning of the query, so we had to pass additional three arguments that can be known only 
      when a table row is fetched so <emphasis>bif:rnd (10, ?s, ?p, ?o)</emphasis> is calculated for every 
      row and thus any given row is either returned or ignored independently from others.</para>
      <para>However, <emphasis>bif:rnd (10, ?s, ?p, ?o)</emphasis> contains a subtle inefficiency. In RDF 
      store, graph nodes are stored as numeric IRI IDs and literal objects can be stored in a separate 
      table. The call of an SQL function needs arguments of traditional SQL datatypes, so the query 
      processor will extract the text of IRI for each node and the full value for each literal object. 
      That is significant waste of time. The workaround is:</para>      
<programlisting><![CDATA[

SELECT ?s ?p ?o

      <title>What are the differences between create, drop, clear and delete Graph?</title>
      <para>In Virtuoso it does not matter whether <emphasis>CREATE GRAPH</emphasis> and 
      <emphasis>DROP GRAPH</emphasis> are called or not. Their purpose is to provide compatibility with 
      the original SPARUL that was designed for Jena. Some Jena triple stores require explicit creation 
      of each graph (like CREATE TABLE in SQL), they report errors if one tries to create a graph twice 
      and so on.</para>
      <para>For Virtuoso, a new graph is not an important system event, it has single quad store shared 
      	by all graphs. When a graph is made by <emphasis>CREATE GRAPH</emphasis>, its name is placed in 
      	an auxiliary table that is used solely to signal appropriate errors on CREATE graph that is 
      	CREATE-d already or on DROP of a missing graph; this table is not used in any way in SPARQL or 
      	other subsystems. In a perfect world, smart development tools will query that table to give 
      	hints to a programmer regarding available graphs, but the reality is not so perfect.</para>
      <para>What's more important is a difference between 
      	<emphasis>DELETE FROM g { ?s ?p ?o } FROM g WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }</emphasis> and 
      	<emphasis>CLEAR GRAPH g</emphasis>, as both will delete all triples from the specified graph &lt;g&gt; with 
      	equal speed, but <emphasis>CLEAR GRAPH</emphasis> will also delete free-text index data about 
      	occurrences of literals in this specific graph. So <emphasis>CLEAR GRAPH</emphasis> will make 
      	the database slightly more compact and the text search slightly faster. (Naturally, 
      	<emphasis>DROP GRAPH</emphasis> makes <emphasis>CLEAR GRAPH</emphasis> inside, not just 
      	<emphasis>DELETE FROM ...</emphasis> )</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT ?wiki,
       ?dbp,
       bif:datediff('second',  xsd:DateTime(?extracted), now()) AS ?secondsAgo
 FROM <http://nl.dbpedia.org>
WHERE
  {
    ?wiki foaf:primaryTopic ?dbp .
    ?dbp dcterms:modified ?extracted .
    FILTER ( bif:datediff('minute', now(), xsd:DateTime(?extracted)) <= 10 )
  }
ORDER BY DESC(?extracted)
LIMIT 30
]]></programlisting>
        <para>Let's take a look at the calculation of:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
FILTER ( bif:datediff('minute', now(),  xsd:DateTime(?extracted)) <= 10 ) .
]]></programlisting>
        <para>For each "is modified" triple we:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>Convert ?extracted to xsd:dateTime;</listitem>
          <listitem>Calculate datediff;</listitem>
          <listitem>Make a comparison and know whether we hit or miss 10 minutes interval</listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Written so, this will lead to a potentially long loop, because even if the optimizer will realize
        that the filter is selective, it can't discover why is it so selective.</para>
        <para>Now let's change the filter to: </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
FILTER ( ?extracted > bif:dateadd('minute', -10, now())) .
]]></programlisting>
        <para><code>now()</code> can be calculated once at the very beginning of the query execution because it
        does not depend on any rows in a given table. Then <code>bif:dateadd</code> has all arguments known and
        thus the whole <code>bif:dateadd('minute', -10, now())</code> can be calculated only once and produce
        some value. Therefor <code>FILTER ( ?extracted &gt; some_known_value )</code> can be represented as a
        single search step: look at index and get triples with known P, known G, O greater than the given one
        and any S. That's pretty fast and predictable step, good for both optimizer and the runtime.</para>
        <para>We can rephrase the query to filter index-friendly:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT ?wiki,
       ?dbp,
        bif:datediff('second',  xsd:DateTime(?extracted) ,
        now()) AS ?secondsAgo
 FROM <http://nl.dbpedia.org>
WHERE
  {
    ?wiki foaf:primaryTopic ?dbp .
    ?dbp dcterms:modified ?extracted .
     FILTER ( ?extracted > bif:dateadd('minute', -10, now()))
  }
ORDER BY DESC (?extracted)
LIMIT 30
]]></programlisting>
        <para>In this case the presence or the absence of the order by does not matter too much, because the query
        is way more straightforward: selective index-friendly filter first, and the selection could be ordered
        naturally via hot index used by the filter.</para>
        <para>Note also that if you know the datatype of an object literal, there's no need to write a cast like
        xsd:dateTime --- it can make an expression index-unfriendly even if it will always return the argument
        unchanged on your specific data.</para>

    	<title>How to Update Large SPARQL Data avoiding due to database checkpoint abortion?</title>    
    	<para>Assume while performing large SPARQL update, for example of triples around 80 millions in total, 
    		one gets the following error which aborts the update: 
    	</para>	
<programlisting><![CDATA[
"Transaction aborted due to a database checkpoint or database-wide
atomic operation. Please retry transaction" .	
]]></programlisting>    	
      <para>The error means that the SPARQL update has possibly encountered a database checkpoint during the 
      	load. Thus one should check the CheckpointInterval in the INI file and possible increase its value:

      can be used for loading large datasets, and it will handle the checkpoint matter automatically.
