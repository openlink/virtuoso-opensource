          <graphic fileref="ui/blog002.jpg" width="356px" depth="157px"/></figure>

  <para>This page lists all users that have a blog account enabled.  Blog users 
  are created using the WebDAV Users Administration page and a few more 
  options, as shown below.</para>

  <para>Community blogging can be activated using the 
  <emphasis>Generate WebSite Pages</emphasis> button.  This will generate a 
  DAV owned blog site that will host other blogs within a community.  It can be 
  configured to allow anyone to register and begin blogging and/or existing 
  blogs can be added to the community by making sure they are part of the 
  same domain (see User Settings below).</para>

          <graphic fileref="ui/blog001.jpg" width="451px" depth="375px"/></figure>

  <para>You create or edit WebDAV users in the usual way, but to enable blog 
  support you must supply the following:</para>

  <simplelist>
    <member><emphasis>Create home directory</emphasis> - check box must be enabled</member>
    <member><emphasis>Home Directory</emphasis> - must be supplied to a 
	location in DAV, preferably <computeroutput>/DAV/&lt;blog-username&gt;/</computeroutput>.</member>
    <member><emphasis>Create Weblog</emphasis> - must also be checked.</member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>Having met this criteria the interface will save the details and create 
  the default blog site within the home directory.  Once details have been set or
  confirmed you should return the Blog Administration page to review the 
  Blog User Settings, below:</para>

	  Thus, when a category is set to "disabled" it means that any post that 
	  falls into this category will not be upstreamed to blogs outside the current 
	  server. When a category is set to "enabled" it means that although posts
