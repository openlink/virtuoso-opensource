<sect1 id="webserver"><title>The HTTP Server</title>

  <para>When a request comes in to one of the network interfaces where
  Virtuoso is listening for HTTP requests, it is matched against a set of virtual directory
  path mappings.  A path mapping has the following attributes:</para>

 <simplelist>
  <member><emphasis>Interface</emphasis> - interface coming from HTTP request</member>
  <member><emphasis>Virtual Host</emphasis> - matched virtual host name</member>
  <member><emphasis>Logical Path</emphasis> - logical path</member>
  <member><emphasis>Mapped Path</emphasis> - physical location of the resource</member>
  <member><emphasis>Is in DAV</emphasis> - If the resource is placed in WebDAV domain</member>
  <member><emphasis>Default page</emphasis> - the name of the page to be returned if none is supplied</member>
  <member><emphasis>Browseable</emphasis> - allows for returning the list of files in a directory if no specific file is requested</member>
  <member><emphasis>Security</emphasis> - security restrictions to the resource</member>
  <member><emphasis>Authentication Function</emphasis> - Virtuoso/PL procedure name, which performs authentication</member>
  <member><emphasis>Realm</emphasis> - an string applied to Authentication function</member>
  <member><emphasis>Request Post-processing Function</emphasis> - Virtuoso/PL procedure name, which performs post-processing action, before sending the response</member>
  <member><emphasis>Database User Account</emphasis> - User account name, on behalf of which  active content  will be executed</member>
 </simplelist>

  <figure id="httpconcept" float="1"><title>HTTP Server Conceptual Diagram</title>
   <graphic fileref="httpconcept.jpg" format="jpeg"></graphic></figure>

 <para>Incoming requests are also checked against the HTTP access control lists.
 These lists rely on the following attributes of the connection to determine whether
 the request should be answered:</para>

 <simplelist>
  <member><emphasis>Client Host or IP Address</emphasis> - the incoming requestor is pattern matched to specify a range.</member>
  <member><emphasis>Destination Host or IP Address</emphasis> - Destination IP/Host match, also applicable to the proxy capabilities.</member>
 </simplelist>

  <para>The Virtuoso HTTP server is HTTP/1.1 compliant.  It can accept persistent
  connections from HTTP/1.1 clients.  The HTTP/1.0 requests are processed as normal
  without the persistent connections feature.</para>

  <para>Persistent HTTP connections offer several advantages, such as:</para>

 <simplelist>
  <member>Reduced CPU usages by opening and closing fewer connections.</member>
  <member>HTTP requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection.
  Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without waiting for each
  response, allowing a single TCP connection to be used much more efficiently with
  lower elapsed time.</member>
  <member>Network traffic is reduced.</member>
  <member>Latency on subsequent requests is reduced.</member>
 </simplelist>

<sect2 id="vspconf"><title>HTTP Server Base Configuration</title>

  <para>The <computeroutput>[HTTPServer]</computeroutput> section of the
  Virtuoso INI file contains parameters that directly affect the HTTP server upon
  server startup.  After the server has been started further configuration can be
  performed using the Visual Server Administration Interface.  Here is an example
  of the section in the INI file:</para>

<programlisting>
[HTTPServer]
  ServerPort = 8890
  ServerRoot = ../vsp
  ServerThreads = 2
  MaxKeepAlives = 10
  KeepAliveTimeout = 10
  DavRoot = DAV
</programlisting>

  <para>The meanings of these parameters are briefly explained here as a quick
  reference for the most frequently used parameters:</para>

     <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>ServerPort</title>
						<para>This specifies the HTTP listen port for the VSP server.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>ServerThreads</title>
						<para>This specifies the number of concurrently serviced HTTP requests.
            If there are more concurrent requests, accepting the connections will be
            deferred until there is a thread ready to serve each.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>ServerRoot = ../vsp</title>
						<para>This is the file system path of the root directory of files served by the Virtuoso
web server.  The index.html in that directory will be served for the / URI.  If relative, the path is
interpreted relative to the server&apos;s working directory.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>MaxKeepAlives = 10</title>
						<para>Connections by HTTP 1.1 clients can remain open after the initial response has been sent.
This parameters sets a cap on how many socket descriptors will at most be taken by keep alive connections.
Such connections will be dropped by the server ahead of timeout if this number would be exceeded.
Thus the maximum number of open sockets for the Virtuoso HTTP server is this number plus the number of threads.
A keep alive connection is by definition not associated to any pending processing on any thread.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>KeepAliveTimeout = 10</title>
						<para>This is a timeout in seconds before Virtuoso closes an idle HTTP 1.1 connection.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<formalpara>
						<title>DavRoot = DAV</title>
						<para>This specifies the root path of DAV resources.  If DAV specific HTTP methods are used on Virtuoso,
these should only reference resources with paths starting with this.  This is the top level DAV collection.
This is matched against URI's after the translation from external to internal URI's through the virtual directory table.
See Virtual Directories below.</para>
					</formalpara>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

  <para>The <link linkend="server">Server Administration chapter</link> contains
  a complete list of the Virtuoso INI file parameters.  In particular, the
  <link linkend="ini_HTTPServer">[HTTPServer] section</link>.</para></tip>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="virtdir"><title>Virtual Directories</title>
  <para>A Virtuoso virtual directory maps logical paths to physical resource
  locations accompanied by rules and/or parameters that govern how the mappings
  respond to user-agent (e.g. Web browser) requests.  This mechanism allows
  physical locations to be obscured or simply reorganized.  Some resource types
  require authentication challenges, such as the Visual Server Administration
  Interface, and/or special headers such as SOAP, which is another HTTP endpoint.</para>

  <para>Virtual directories are useful when one server has to provide access to
  several Web sites.  Redirects are not a universal solution to this, it is far better to
  define virtual directories that point to the other sites.  Suppose that we have
  two companies, "a" and "b", that are to share a Virtuoso server but want to
  represented on the Web by <computeroutput>www.a.com</computeroutput>
  and <computeroutput>www.b.com</computeroutput> respectively.  Their pages
  could be stored in directories "/a" and "/b" on the server, whilst virtual directories
  map requests appropriately: </para>

  <programlisting><![CDATA[
  http://www.a.com/  --> /a
  http://www.b.com/  --> /b
]]></programlisting>

  <para>Hence, user-agent requests for <computeroutput>www.a.com</computeroutput>
  receive pages from /a, and likewise for "b".  Requests under these domains are
  mapped back to their physical location such as the request for the URI
  <computeroutput>http://www.a.com/images/picture.jpg</computeroutput>
  retrieves the file <computeroutput>/a/images/picture.jpg</computeroutput>.</para>

  <para>Virtual directory definitions are held within the system table DB.DBA.HTTP_PATH.
  Virtual directories can be administered in three basic ways:</para>

  <simplelist>
   <member>Using the Visual Administration Interface via a Web browser.</member>
   <member>Using the functions <function>vhost_define()</function> and
   <function>vhost_remove()</function>.</member>
   <member>Updating the system table directory using SQL statements.</member>
  </simplelist>

  <tip><title>See Also:</title>
  <para><link linkend="httpvirtualdirs">Virtual Directory Administration UI</link></para>
  <para><link linkend="fn_vhost_define">vhost_define()</link>, <link linkend="fn_vhost_remove">vhost_remove()</link></para>
  <para><link linkend="davhttppath">HTTP_PATH system table</link></para>
  </tip>

  <para>Virtuoso matches user-agent requests against a logical path using
  the longest entry that matches the path extracted  from the URI.  Suppose
  we have two entries  '<computeroutput>/a/b</computeroutput>' and
  '<computeroutput>/a</computeroutput>' and a request is made of:
  '<computeroutput>http://foo.bar/a/b/c.html</computeroutput>', will match
  the entry for '<computeroutput>/a/b</computeroutput>'.</para>

  <para>First, Virtuoso will attempt to locate the physical path that has been
  mapped to a virtual host, interface and logical path.  The virtual host
  corresponds to the 'Host' header field value from HTTP/1.1 requests.  If the
  first step does not succeed then the server will try resolving the interface
  and logical path.  Failing that, the default step will attempt to resolve the path
  directly to a physical location.</para>

  <figure float="1"><title>HTTP Virtual Directory Matching</title>
    <graphic fileref="virtualdirectories.jpg" width="570px" depth="335px"/></figure>

<note><title>Note:</title>
  <para>HTTP 1.0 does not use the HOST header.  Virtuoso will have little
  choice but to send HTTP 1.0 user-agents the contents of the default
  virtual host definition for the interface.  </para></note>

    <para>Thus if the following mappings are in effect:</para>
			<programlisting>
/	-&gt;  /DAV
/doc	-&gt;  http://docs.biz.com:/
/admin	-&gt;  /admin
</programlisting>
			<para>
The following translations would be made:
</para>
			<programlisting>
/doc/howto/intro.html	   -&gt; http://docs.biz.com:/howto/intro.html
/admin/help.vsp		   -&gt; /admin/help.vsp
/gizmo/doc.xml		   -&gt; /DAV/gizmo/doc.xml
</programlisting>
			<para>
Thus, the longest match is selected and the matching substring is replaced by
the right hand side of the mapping.  Note that this is also how automatic proxying takes place,
since a physical path beginning with http:// will be passed forward to a remote server.
	</para>

<sect3 id="defaultpageanddirbrws"><title>Default Pages And Directory Browsing</title>
  <para>
For each virtual host or logical path pair we can define a list of default pages.  If the
requested URL path is a directory then the server checks the default page definition
for that virtual directory, if a default page exists then the path will be internally
expanded to include its name, ands its contents returned.
</para>

<example id="ex_defpage"><title>Default Page</title>
<para>if we have a mapping for the host:</para>
<programlisting>www.a.com</programlisting>
<para>with the logical path mapping of:</para>
<programlisting>'/' mapped to '/a'</programlisting>
<para>with default page 'index.htm', then if the URL</para>
<programlisting>http://www.a.com/</programlisting>
<para>is requested the server will try to send the content of '/a/index.htm'.</para>
</example>

  <para>
The same mechanism is used to determine whether a directory listing  is to be
returned.  If a mapping is defined to have 'Browseable' set to a number greater
than zero then the server, if a default page does not exist or is not defined,
a directory listing will be returned to the calling client.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="virtandmultihosting"><title>Virtual Hosting and Multi Hosting</title>

<para>
The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of maintaining more than one server
on one machine, differentiated by their apparent host name.  It is often
desirable for companies sharing a web server to have their own domains, with
web servers accessible as www.company1.com and www.company2.com, without
requiring the user to know any extra path information.  The Virtual host can
be IP-based or non-IP.  The IP-based (Multi Hosting) refers to practice of
having one machine listen for incoming requests on different network interfaces
and respond with different pages.  The non-IP-based (Virtual Hosting) refers
to the practice of one machine having many DNS aliases, and requests from
client to a specific alias returning a different response regarding content
of 'Host' HTTP header field.  Virtuoso supports IP-based, virtual IP-based,
and name-based virtual hosts. </para>
  <para>
For distinct IP-based, hosts are used to determine on which interfaces
Virtuoso will listen and accept HTTP requests.
</para>

<sect3 id="virtproxy"><title>Virtuoso As A Proxy</title>

  <para>The Virtuoso HTTP server can act as a proxy server on the same port
  as the HTTP port.  You can put the host and port that the Virtuoso HTTP server
  is listening on, into your browser proxy settings and all requests will be
  processed by it.  Also this can be used to retrieve a page inside VSP.</para>

  <para>The physical path setting of a virtual directory definition can be URL to
  another HTTP server.  In which case Virtuoso will act as a proxy to that site
  when the logical path for it is requested.</para>

  <tip><title>See Also:</title>
  <para><link linkend="furthervsp">Virtuoso also provides VSP functions for proxying.</link></para>
  <para><link linkend="fn_http_proxy"><function>http_proxy()</function></link>.</para></tip>

  <para>The nature of Virtuoso's Web Proxying ability makes it easy and
  seamless to bind multiple websites under one roof.  Existing sites do not
  have to move or change to be integrated under the Virtuoso Proxy.  Simply
  map them under a logical path name.  They can be mapped multiple times
  or from multiple ports.</para>

  <para>If you already have pages written and working from other
  servers via ASP or PHP, then you will be able to run these servers concurrently
  with Virtuoso so they can share form data and give dynamic content from various
  sources, consistent with our value proposition of maximum incorporation of new
  technologies with minimum disruption to existing infrastructure.  Whether
  these servers were hosted on various machines or the same machine
  there is no need to expose their running ports and services.  This makes the
  end user experience cleaner, and helps maintain some server security and/or
  anonymity.</para>

  <note><title>Note:</title>
    <para>Virtuoso  provides runtime hosting capabilities and PHP support,
    therefore ASP.Net and PHP and other applications can be run and hosted directly within
the  file system or  WebDAV.</para></note>

  <para>Suppose that you have two machines running existing web servers that
  serve various parts of your intranet.  One web server may have been
  constructed for or by your sales department while the other server may have
  been a built by the support department.  These servers could be resolved by
  http://sales.mycompany.com/ and http://support.mycompany.com/ respectively.</para>

  <para>You can place Virtuoso on another server and start integrating your
  existing sites under this installation.  You may use the Visual  Server Administration
  Interface or choose to use the following commands via the isql interface:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.VHOST_DEFINE(lpath=>'/sales', ppath=>'http://sales.mycompany.com/');
DB.DBA.VHOST_DEFINE(lpath=>'/support', ppath=>'http://support.mycompany.com/');
]]></programlisting>

	<para>This way your old servers will exist under /sales/ and /support/ of
  your new server.  Now you can start adding virtuoso .vsp pages to your
  new Virtuoso server and they operate interleaved with your existing pages to
  add new life and functionality as required.</para>

  <para>You may decide that you want to install Virtuoso onto a server
  where a web server already exists.  If you plan to use Virtuoso as your
  default web server and the proxy to your existing server then you will need to
  make sure that the servers run on different ports. The default port is 80,
  you will have to configure Virtuoso to use this port from the virtuoso.ini file
  and then move your existing web server port to another number.
  Afterwards the procedure is similar:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
DB.DBA.VHOST_DEFINE(lpath=>'/apache', ppath=>'http://localhost:90/');
]]></programlisting>

<sect4 id="apachedoingproxy"><title>Proxying Virtuoso via Apache</title>

  <para>You may also achieve the same goal as above but in reverse, using
  another web server as a proxy in front of  Virtuoso.  If you have an existing
  Apache server that you want to keep as you default web server then you can
  set up a proxy within Apache to Virtuoso.</para>

  <para>Firstly you will need to make sure that Apache can make use of the
  mod_proxy module available from most Apache distribution sites.  You then have
  to make sure that it is referenced in your httpd.conf (or apache.conf) file.
  You should have something like:</para>

    <screen>
...
LoadModule proxy_module       modules/libproxy.so
...
AddModule mod_proxy.c
...
</screen>

  <!--para>You will then need to add a configuration line to the httpd.conf file
  to let Apache know how to proxy requests Virtuoso:</para>

    <screen>
ProxyPass /virtserver   http://MyVirtuosoServer:8890/
</screen-->
<sect5 id="apachedoingproxyconf"><title>Configuration steps</title>

<para>Below we will use the &lt;Location&gt; directive to simplify the configuration:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<Location /virtuoso/>
   ProxyPass               http://localhost:8890/
   ProxyPassReverse        /
</Location>
]]></programlisting>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>Set the ProxyPass directive:

<para>The ProxyPass directive makes Apache to change all incoming URLs and map 
it to the internal http endpoint.</para>
<para>So when the browser makes a request for:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
http://localhost/virtuoso/conductor/login.vsp
]]></programlisting>

<para>it is rewritten to use:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
http://localhost:8890/conductor/login.vsp
]]></programlisting>

<para>before sending the request over to the Virtuoso server.</para>
</listitem>  
  <listitem>Set the ProxyPassReverse directive:
  <para>The ProxyPassReverse directive rewrites the HTTP Headers that come back 
from Virtuoso to map back to the external URL. This is needed for e.g. 303 Location 
redirects where Virtuoso will use:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Location: http://localhost:8890/conductor/pageXXX.vsp
]]></programlisting>
<para>which Apache needs to rewrite to:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Location: http://localhost/virtuoso/conductor/pageXXX.vsp
]]></programlisting>
<para>before sending the reply back to the browser.</para>
</listitem>
  <listitem><para>If the mapping is / ---&gt; / instead of /virtuoso/ ---&gt; / then the settings should be done, 
since ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse only deal with rewriting urls and http headers.</para>
<para>When however there is a path mapping, there is a third step to take:</para>
<para>Pages can contain clickable links like:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<a href="/conductor/mypage.vsp">Click Here</a>
]]></programlisting>
<para>If you click on this link in your browser, it would use:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
http://localhost/conductor/mypage.vsp
]]></programlisting>
<para>which does not map back to your /virtuoso/ vpath in apache.</para>
<para>As phpBB3 has been written from outset to cater for this 
situation, it will always need to recalculate fully qualified 
host/path names everywhere in its pages, which is not always very practical.</para>
<para>Thus Apache needs to be configured to do page rewriting as well as in:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
     ProxyHTMLEnable         On
     ProxyHTMLURLMap         / /virtuoso/
     ProxyHTMLURLMap         http://localhost:8890/ /virtuoso/
]]></programlisting>
<para>This will rewrite the content of every page to make sure that links 
inside the page are rewritten to use the external mapping of this instance.</para>

<para>If you have set Virtuoso to use <code>EnabledGzipContent=1</code>, then you need to 
tell apache it may need to gunzip the content before doing this rewrite 
with the following line:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
     SetOutputFilter         INFLATE;DEFLATE
]]></programlisting>

<para>Although this takes a bit extra CPU power etc, it is still practical to 
setup a virtual path on user's own system that points to some external system.</para>

<para>For example, add this to your httpd.conf to get a mapping to dbpedia-live instance:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<Location /dbp/>
     ProxyPass               http://dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com/
     ProxyPassReverse        /
     ProxyHTMLURLMap         / /dbp/
     ProxyHTMLURLMap         http://dbpedia-live.openlinksw.com/ /dbp/
     SetOutputFilter         INFLATE;DEFLATE
</Location>
]]></programlisting>


<para>Now you should be able to use for ex.:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
http://localhost/dbp/page/London
]]></programlisting>

</orderedlist>

the 'Realm' value.  The result from the procedure must be 1

The Virtuoso HTTP session management consists of functions for session

The pre and post-processing functions are used to save and restore session
data between HTTP posts, usually to and from a session table.</para>

  <para>Session management must be enable by settings the flag for persistent
  session variables in virtual directory mapping.  Virtual directory mappings use
  the <emphasis>persistent_session_variables</emphasis> flag, which when
specified, session variables can be used in a post-process function to determine
if the session variables content must be stored on to the session table or not.
</para>
  <para>
The post-processing function hook can be any user-defined Virtuoso/PL procedure,

The Virtuoso shared object library enables you to create your own custom
extensions to the Virtuoso HTTP server and create custom VSEs.  Support
for PHP page execution was implemented using this functionality.  Virtuoso
can automatically switch processing mode from VSP to PHP or some other custom
extension based on the extension of the files being requested from the HTTP server.
To enable Virtuoso to process files of a different extension you have to write a
VSE handler where part of the name contains the
extension: <emphasis>__http_handler_[extension]</emphasis>.  The VSEs
for HTTP handling must have the following parameters:

This attribute is used for the owner's Web ID. For testing purposes we used OpenSSL demo CA 
to generate such certificates. If you are not using the OpenSSL demo CA, you must first setup  
a self-signed CA; read OpenSSL documents on how to do this.</para> 
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>Add the following line to the <code>[usr_cert]</code> section of the <code>openssl.cnf</code> 
file:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
subjectAltName=$ENV::ALTNAME	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>Set the environment variable <code>ALTNAME</code> to the owner's Web ID, e.g., 
<programlisting><![CDATA[
export ALTNAME=URI:http://localhost/dataspace/person/myname#this	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>Make a self-signed certificate, e.g., 
<programlisting><![CDATA[
$ CA.pl -newreq (follow the dialog) 
$ CA.pl -sign	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>When asked to commit the certificate, make sure you see several lines above, like
<programlisting><![CDATA[
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
    URI:http://localhost/dataspace/person/myname#this 	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>If your browser wants a <code>PKCS#12</code> bundle, you must make one
<programlisting><![CDATA[
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in newcert.pem -inkey newkey.pem -out mycert.p12 	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>Rename <code>newcert.pem</code> and <code>newkey.pem</code>, to <code>mycert.pem</code> 
and <code>mykey.pem</code> for example.  
</listitem>
</orderedlist>  	
</listitem>
  <listitem>Move <code>newcert.pem</code>, <code>newkey.pem</code>, and <code>cacert.pem</code> 
into the server's working directory.  In our test case, we put the keys in a '<code>keys</code>' 
sub-directory, and added the following lines to the <code>[HTTPServer]</code> section of the Virtuoso 
INI file, <code>virtuoso.ini</code>:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
SSLPort                     = 4443
SSLCertificate              = ./keys/localhost.cert.pem
SSLPrivateKey               = ./keys/localhost.key.pem
X509ClientVerifyCAFile      = ./keys/localhost.ca.pem
X509ClientVerify            = 1
X509ClientVerifyDepth       = 15	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>Also in the Virtuoso INI file, in the <code>[URIQA]</code> section, <code>DefaultHost</code>
(<code>localhost:8890</code> below) must be edited to correspond to the DNS-resolvable host name 
("CNAME") of the Virtuoso host, combined with the <code>ServerPort</code> as set in the 
<code>[HTTPServer]</code> section of the same INI file. 
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[URIQA]
DynamicLocal = 1
DefaultHost  = localhost:8890	
]]></programlisting>
<para>For example, if the CNAME of the host is <code>virtuoso.example.com</code>, and the 
<code>ServerPort</code> is <code>4321</code>, the <code>DefaultHost</code> should be set to 
<code>virtuoso.example.com:4321</code></para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[URIQA]
DynamicLocal = 1
DefaultHost  = virtuoso.example.com:4321	
]]></programlisting>
</listitem>
  <listitem>Start the Virtuoso server, and look at the log file.  Once HTTPS is up, you should see 
something like:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
HTTPS Using X509 Client CA ....
HTTPS/X509 server online at 4443	
]]></programlisting>
