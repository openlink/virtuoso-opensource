<sect1 id="ws-routing"><title>Web Services Routing Protocol (WS-Routing)</title>

 <para>The SOAP Routing Protocol (WS-Routing) is a SOAP-based, stateless protocol
 for exchanging SOAP messages from an initial sender to an ultimate receiver,
 potentially via a set of intermediaries.  The WS-Routing protocol is
 implemented as a SOAP extension, embedded in a SOAP Header entry.</para>

 <para>The WS-Routing implementation consists of SOAP Header processing.  The
 header processing handler for the WS-Routing header determines if the Virtuoso
 SOAP server can act as an intermediary or a endpoint depending on the rules
 in message path.</para>

 <para>This implementation supports HTTP only.  Message Id's generated are UUIDs.</para>

 <sect2 id="wsrconfig"><title>Configuration</title>

  <para>Setting-up the WS-Routing for a SOAP service requires you to:</para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem><para>make a virtual directory bound to the SOAP endpoint processor (/SOAP)</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>add the following SOAP options:</para>
    <simplelist>
     <member>WS-RP=yes;</member>
     <member>wsrp-from=[identification for endpoint];</member>
    </simplelist>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="wsrtraversingmsgpaths"><title>Traversing Message Paths</title>

  <para>The initial WS-Routing sender generates a WS-Routing "path" header that
  indicates the route.  The path can indicate a route via one or more
  intermediaries using the "via" elements as sub-elements of the
  "fwd" element.  The initial sender indicates the ultimate destination by
  using a "to" element.  In the absence of a "to" element the ultimate
  destination is deduced by the last "via" in the "fwd" element.  The second
  option occurs most commonly when an ultimate destination reverses roles,
  becomes an initial sender, and uses the reverse path in a received message
  as a forward path to send a response to the original sender.</para>

  <para>In addition, the initial WS-Routing sender inserts a reverse path
  for indicating where the initial sender can receive reverse path messages.
  The initial sender sets the ultimate destination in the reverse path using
  a "via" element as a sub-element of the "rev" element.</para>

  <para>A WS-Routing receiver receiving a WS-Routing message inspects the SOAP
  header and performs the following operations:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>If no "fwd" element is present or if the "fwd" element does not
   contain any "via" elements then inspect the "to" element and verify that the
   value identifies itself.  If this is the case then THIS receiver is the
   ultimate destination.  If there is no "to" element or if the value of the
   "to" element does not identify THIS WS-Routing receiver then generate a
   fault.</listitem>
   <listitem>If the "fwd" element is present and contains one or more "via"
   element(s) then remove the top "via" element listed in the "fwd" element
   and verify that the value of that "via" element is either empty or
   identifies THIS WS-Routing receiver.  Failing that generate an appropriate
   WS-Routing fault <!--(see section 5.2). --> If, after removing the top "via"
   element there are no remaining "via" element(s) listed in the "fwd" element,
   and there is no "to" element, then THIS WS-Routing receiver is
   the ultimate destination.</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>A WS-Routing intermediary MUST follow these additional rules:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>If a "rev" element is present then add a "via" element as the
   first "via" element listed in the "rev" element with a value indicating the
   reverse path endpoint.  If a reverse path endpoint cannot be provided then
   generate a 751 "Reverse Path Unavailable" WS-Routing fault.</listitem>
   <listitem>If one or more "via" element(s) remain in the "fwd" element then
   forward the WS-Routing message to the endpoint identified by the new top
   "via" element listed in the "fwd" element.</listitem>
   <listitem>If there are no remaining "via" element(s) listed in the "fwd"
   element but there is a "to" element then forward the WS-Routing message to
   the endpoint identified by the "to" element.</listitem>
   <listitem>In the last two cases if the forwarding does not succeed then
   generate the appropriate WS-Routing fault.</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
