<title>VSP Guide</title>

<sect2 id="vspintro"><title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
Virtuoso Server Pages are the equivalent of a stored procedure
in a Web page that is compiled when it is first read by the Virtuoso
server.  Virtuoso detects when  the '.vsp' file is modified
and recompiles the procedure.
Since VSP is essentially Virtuoso PL in a Web page you can do anything
that PL can, either directly or from interaction with the user.
VSP gives you the advantage of not having to worry about making
connections to the database. You also avoid the overhead of RPCs
because the HTTP server is built into Virtuoso.  When you write a VSP page the
connection is automatic since you are already in Virtuoso.
</para>
  <para>
VSP is server script and is therefore executed in the server as it is
encountered on the page.  For this reason client (JavaScript) and server
script cannot directly interact but can supplement each other.  You can
call JavaScript inside a VSP loop, for example, to manipulate something
that already exists on the page but you cannot pass variables by reference
from VSP directly to JavaScript or vice versa.
</para>
  <para>
Page flow control can be managed using FORMs.  The state of the page is
defined in form fields such as INPUT boxes and TEXTAREA boxes and then
passed to the next form or page using POST.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="htmlusage">
<title>Simple HTML FORM usage</title>

  <para>
We start with a small example that shows the source of a page including a
FORM with data from the user being sent when a submit button is pressed.
We then examine the elements and attributes of this simple form that are
important to us at this stage.
</para>

<sect3 id="basicform"><title>Basic Forms</title>

<example><title>Simple Forms</title>
<programlisting>
&lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;Simple FORM demo&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;
  &lt;FORM METHOD=&quot;POST&quot; ACTION=&quot;formdemo_receiver.vsp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Test form, type some info and click Submit&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;TEXT&quot; NAME=&quot;myInput&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; NAME=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/FORM&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</programlisting>
</example>
  <para>
The METHOD attribute of a FORM TAG in a VSP page can be either GET or POST.  The GET method allows the form submission to
be contained completely in a URL; this can be advantageous because it permits bookmarking in browsers,
but it also prevents form data from containing non

ASCII characters such as accented letters and special symbols
and restricts the amount of form data that can be handled.  The GET method is l



mited by the maximum length of the URL that the
server and browser can process. To be safe, any form whose input might contain non-ASCII
characters or more than 100 characters should use METHOD=&quot;POST&quot;.
</para>
  <para>
With the POST method, the form input is submitted as an HTTP POST request with the form data sent in the
body of the request.  Most current browsers are unable to bookmark POST requests,
but POST does not entail the character encoding and length restrictions imposed by GET.
</para>
  <para>
The ACTION attribute of FORM specifies the URI of the form handler.  This will usually be another web page that
performs some action based on the data that is sent from the originating form.  The URI could point to the same page
as the data originated and for pages that perform a well-defined small set of functions it usually does.
When a page needs to manage multiple states there needs to be some flow control that can determine how the page
was reached; for example, to differentiate whether it arrived at as a result of someone clicking on the submit button or it is the first time the page has
been visited.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="formvalues"><title>Exchanging Values in Forms</title>
  <para>
Now we add some VSP to check the values of the parameters in the form.  VSP markup is typically
contained in &lt;?vsp ... ?&gt; blocks.
</para>

<example><title>Forms and Values</title>
<programlisting>
&lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;Simple FORM demo&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;
  &lt;P&gt;Last value sent:

  &lt;?vsp
    http(get_keyword('myInput', params, 'no value'));
   ?&gt;

&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;FORM METHOD=&quot;POST&quot; ACTION=&quot;formdemo.vsp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Test form, type some info and click Submit&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;TEXT&quot; NAME=&quot;myInput&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; NAME=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/FORM&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</programlisting>
</example>
  <para>
This is the same example as above but now it uses the same page for the
form handler and displays the parameters each time.  Clicking the Submit
button takes you to the same page and displays whatever you typed in
the field last time.
</para>
  <para>
The VSP block uses two nested functions.  The <function>http()</function>
function allows you to send data to the HTTP client, the browser.
What we send to the browser is the result of the <function>get_keyword()</function>
function, which has three parameters:
<parameter>search_for</parameter>, <parameter>source_array</parameter>,
and <parameter>default_val</parameter>.  It searches
for the keyword-value pair (keyword=value) where the keyword matches
the <parameter>search_for</parameter> parameter (in this case 'myInput')
in the array passed in the <parameter>source_array</parameter> parameter.
It returns the value
if one is found; otherwise returns the <parameter>default_val</parameter> parameter in the
function, in this case 'no value'.
The<parameter> params</parameter> argument is a special array that contains
all page parameters from the previous FORM state.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="formandvspconditions"><title>Conditional Processing</title>

  <para>
Now we extend this further to add some conditional control so that
if a value was entered we can respond directly to it.
We will also use a variable this time, which must be declared first.
</para>

<example><title>Conditional Processing Using IF</title>
<programlisting>
&lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;Simple FORM demo&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;

  &lt;?vsp
	declare _myInput varchar;

	_myInput := get_keyword('myInput', params, '');

    if (_myInput &lt;&gt; '')
	{	http('&lt;P&gt;Hello, ');
		http(_myInput);
		http('&lt;/P&gt;');
	}
	else
	{	http('&lt;P&gt;Please enter your name&lt;/P&gt;');
	}
   ?&gt;

  &lt;FORM METHOD=&quot;POST&quot; ACTION=&quot;formdemo.vsp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;TEXT&quot; NAME=&quot;myInput&quot; VALUE=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; NAME=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/FORM&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</programlisting>
</example>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="vsppgctrl"><title>Further Page Control</title>

  <para>
We now extend this to control the whole content of the page.
In this example we see that VSP and HTML can be interleaved.
</para>

<example><title>Page Control</title>
<programlisting>
&lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;Simple FORM demo&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;

  &lt;?vsp
	declare _myInput varchar;
	declare Mode varchar;

	_myInput := get_keyword('myInput', params, '');
	Mode := get_keyword('submit', params, '');

    if (Mode = 'Submit')
	{
   ?&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Hello, &lt;?vsp http(_myInput); ?&gt;
	&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;FORM METHOD=&quot;POST&quot; ACTION=&quot;demo4.vsp&quot;&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;HIDDEN&quot; NAME=&quot;myInput&quot; VALUE=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; NAME=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Again&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;

  &lt;?vsp
	}
	  else
	{
   ?&gt;

  &lt;P&gt;Please enter you name&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;FORM METHOD=&quot;POST&quot; ACTION=&quot;demo4.vsp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;TEXT&quot; NAME=&quot;myInput&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; NAME=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/FORM&gt;

  &lt;?vsp
    }
  ?&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</programlisting>
</example>

  <para>We start by setting the mode based on whether the Submit
  button has been pressed.  When the mode has changed a different version of the page
  is sent to the browser.  In the new version, the Again button the appears, to return you
  to the previous state when pressed.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="params"><title>Communicating Parameters Between Pages</title>
<para>Now we will use two pages to do the same job as in the demo above.</para>
<example><title>Using more than one page</title>

<para>Page 1</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>Multi Page Demo</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  <P>Please enter you name</P>
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="demo5_2.vsp">
    <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="myInput" />
    <INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="submit" VALUE="Submit" />
  </FORM>
  </BODY>
</HTML>
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>Page 2</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>Multi Page Demo</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  <P>The value you entered was:
  <?vsp
    http(get_keyword('submit', params, 'no data'));
  ?>
  </P>
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="demo5_1.vsp">
    <INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="submit" VALUE="Back" />
  </FORM>
  </BODY>
</HTML>
]]>
</programlisting>
</example>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="formsandjs"><title>Using JavaScript to Control Forms</title>
<para>JavaScript is a programming language that can be used in the browser
and is useful for client-side programming.   It is  useful to be able
to do some work on the
client machine before making another round trip to the server for more processing.
JavaScript is also useful for making things more appealing to the Web
page viewer. </para>
<para>JavaScript can be made to respond to events within the browser such as
when the mouse is moved over a link, a graphic or a button or when the mouse is
clicked on some part of the page.  This can be achieved by using event
handlers within the HTML tags and placing JavaScript code in their content.
Common event handlers are <emphasis>onMouseOver</emphasis>, <emphasis>onMouseClick</emphasis>,
<emphasis>onMouseOut</emphasis>, <emphasis>onChange</emphasis>, and the
like.</para>

<para>A simple but useful example of this would be to simplify one of the
previous examples by placing a handler on the text box so that you do not have to
press the submit button to send the form to the server:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="demo5_2.vsp" NAME="demo5_2">
    <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="myInput" onChange="document.demo5_2.submit()" />
    <INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="submit" VALUE="Submit" />
  </FORM>
]]></programlisting>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="dbinteraction"><title>Interacting with the Database</title>

<para>This section describes manipulating data within Virtuoso
from VSP.  Unless the required tables already exist, new ones will need to be
created.  This example will involve a simple table of people and a series
of pages for adding, editing, viewing, and deleting its entries.</para>

<sect3 id="basiccreatetable"><title>Creating a Table</title>
<para>Tables should be created so that their entries can be uniquely identified.
This is very important so that if we need to edit or delete one particular entry
we can distinguish it from other entries.  A <emphasis>primary key</emphasis>
is how a database enforces unique rows, by refusing to allow
duplicate data to be inserted.  It is up to the user to choose a column in the
table to act as a primary key.  Sometimes one or more of the columns of data are naturally
unique either singularly or in composite; other times it is necessary
to add a column to contain unique codes for each row.</para>
<tip><title>See Also:</title>
<para><link linkend="pkeycons">Primary Keys</link></para>
</tip>
<para>Here is the definition of the simple table that will be used:</para>
<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE DB.DBA.DEMO_PEOPLE (
  EMAIL VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  FORENAME VARCHAR(100),
  SURNAME VARCHAR(100)
);
</programlisting>
<para>The email address has been selected as a primary key.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="insertingvalues"><title>Basic Form Input Page</title>
<para>After the table has been created; for example via Virtuoso's
iSQL utility; it will need some data.
For this we create a &quot;New Person&quot; page.  This page uses form
inputs and some VSP code to determine whether
an insert button was pressed.  If the insert button is pressed then the
page takes submitted values from the POST and uses them to construct
an SQL statement that inserts a new row into the table.  This is
demonstrated below:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>New Person Page</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  <?vsp

    declare _email, _forename, _surname varchar;

    _email := get_keyword('email', params, '');
    _forename := get_keyword('forename', params, '');
    _surname := get_keyword('surname', params, '');

    -- insert new person if we came from the insert button
    if ('' <> get_keyword('ins_button', params, ''))
    {
      INSERT INTO DB.DBA.DEMO_PEOPLE(EMAIL, FORENAME, SURNAME)
        VALUES(_email, _forename, _surname);
    }
  ?>
  <P>Please enter the details of new person:</P>

  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="demo_people_add.vsp">
  <TABLE>
    <TR><TH>Email:</TH><TD><INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" /></TD></TR>
    <TR><TH>Forename:</TH><TD><INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="forename" /></TD></TR>
    <TR><TH>Surname:</TH><TD><INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="surname" /></TD></TR>
  </TABLE>

  <INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="ins_button" VALUE="Insert" />
  </FORM>

  </BODY>
</HTML>
]]></programlisting>

<para>The underscores were added to this example to keep the param
variables and page variables visibly distinguishable.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="retrtabvals"><title>Displaying Table Data in a VSP Page</title>
<para>Now that some data exists in the table we need a way to
display it.  The FOR ... DO construct is used to construct the insides of
an HTML table:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>The People Page</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  <P>The Peoples' Details</P>

  <TABLE>

  </TABLE>

</HTML>
]]></programlisting>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="deletevals"><title>Simple Form Delete Page</title>
<para>The page above can easily be extended to allow deletion.  For each row an 'action' link is added.  The action
Remove link hardwires a form GET on the URL.  This is then
intercepted by the IF condition looking for the <parameter>remove</parameter> parameter. </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<HTML>
  <HEAD>

  </TABLE>
  </FORM>
  </BODY>
</HTML>
]]></programlisting>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="editvals"><title>Simple Form Edit Page</title>
<para>The last step is to have a way to edit rows of the
table.  To do this, we combine everything that we have so far
and use the SQL UPDATE statement to update the row.  The EMAIL
column is not made updateable since this is the primary key.

<sect2 id="vspforumsapp"><title>The Forums Application</title>
<para>
The "Forums" Application is a World Wide Web Application for posting, reading
and searching of messages developed under the Virtuoso VDBMS with a wide usage
of Virtuoso Server Pages (VSP) and server-side XSL-T transformation.
</para>
  <para>
Messages in the forums are classified to forums and sub-forums by
interest.  Posting is only allowed for registered users.  Registration is
performed via a registration form.  Every registered user can create new a
theme, post new messages to an existing theme or reply to an existing
message.  Unregistered users can only search, browse, and read existing
themes and messages.
</para>
<sect3 id="forumsprinciples"><title>Principles</title>
<para>
The application is based on VSPs, XML and XSLT transformations.  The
VSPs are used to produce XML documents that are transformed to HTML using
server side XSLT.  The design and appearance of the
application depends solely on XSLT style sheets.  This allows us to divide
the development into two distinct parts: layout and design, and
functionality of the application.
</para>
  <para>
Session management is based on URL manipulation and persistent HTTP session
variables.  The messages are stored in Database as XML documents with a free-text
index applied over them.
</para>

The basic principles of the application's implementation are:
</para>
<simplelist>
<member>The result of a VSP execution is a well-formed XML document.</member>
<member>Use the Virtuoso server to do server-side XSLT transformations
with appropriate style sheets whenever needed.</member>
<member>Use URL manipulations for session management.</member>
<member>Use post-processing functions to provide commonly used
parameters (such as user ID) as session variables.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>
If users are not logged in they can access all pages of the site, but if
they want to insert a new theme or create a new message, they have to log
in.  When users attempt to create or insert, they will be prompted with
the login page.  When they log in, the forums application will take them
directly to the form for inserting messages or themes.
If users are not logged in, the name 'anonymous' is displayed, instead of
the e-mail address that would be displayed if they were logged in.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="forumssrchpg"><title>The Search Page</title>
<para>Users can search in three ways:</para>
	<simplelist>
	  <member>Theme title: titles of message that are titles of themes.</member>
		<member>Message title: titles of message that have the current theme as parent.</member>
		<member>Message body: bodies of messages that have different themes as parents.</member>
	</simplelist>

	<para>Search results contain information about how many hits were
	found, and for each hit the following:</para>
	<simplelist>
	  <member>Message title: the title of the current message.  When you search
		in message bodies, the message titles are displayed.</member>
		<member>Time: date the message or theme was inserted.</member>
		<member>Author: author of the message or theme.</member>
	</simplelist>

  <para>
	The search page provides the interface for searching contents of forums
	including messages and titles.</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?vsp
  declare id, acount, aresults integer;
  declare aquery, awhat, askiped, search_res, sid, uid, url, usr varchar;

  -- &gt; at this point we instruct server to do server-side XSLT transformation
	-- &gt;    over resultant document
  -- &gt; The transformation will be done before sending the document to the user-agent
  -- &gt;    and after page execution is done.
	-- &gt; To provide flexible file location we use a registry setting for XSLT
	-- &gt;    style sheets
  http_xslt(sprintf ('file:%s/search.xsl', registry_get ('app_forums_xslt_location')));

  -- &gt; because the application does URL poisoning for session management
  -- &gt; we must retrieve the request parameters:

  -- &gt; the session ID
  sid      := get_keyword('sid', params, '0');
  -- &gt; the query text
  aquery   := get_keyword('q',params,'');
  -- &gt; the query locator (for what we searching)
  awhat    := get_keyword('wh',params,'t');
  -- &gt; how many records to skip
  askiped  := atoi (get_keyword('sk',params,'0'));
  -- &gt; how many results to return
  aresults := atoi (get_keyword('rs',params,'10'));
  -- &gt; hits count
  acount   := atoi (get_keyword('c',params,'0'));

  url := 'thread.vsp';

  -- &gt; also we get the user ID from the session variables
  uid := connection_get ('pid');
  usr := connection_get ('usr');

  -- &gt; now we are ready and call the stored procedure that returns the result from search
  search_res := FORI_SEARCH_RES (aquery, awhat, askiped, aresults, acount);
?&gt;
&lt;!-- now we produce the result as well-formed XML document --&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;page&gt;
&lt;sid&gt;&lt;?=sid?&gt;&lt;/sid&gt;
&lt;usr&gt;&lt;?=usr?&gt;&lt;/usr&gt;
&lt;url&gt;&lt;?=url?&gt;&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;nav_2&gt;&lt;?vsp http(FORI_SEARCH_FORM (sid, aquery, awhat, askiped, aresults, acount)); ?&gt;&lt;/nav_2&gt;
&lt;css_1/&gt;
&lt;squery&gt;&lt;?=aquery?&gt;&lt;/squery&gt;
&lt;swhat&gt;&lt;?=awhat?&gt;&lt;/swhat&gt;

&lt;sresults&gt;&lt;?=aresults?&gt;&lt;/sresults&gt;

<sect3 id="forumssrchdesc"><title>Search Page Analysis</title>
  <para>
	First we declare the variables used inside the page.  In VSP, variables can be
	defined at any time, but it is generally good practice is to declare them
	near the top.
</para>
	<para>
	We call <function>http_xslt()</function> with a file URL parameter.  This instructs the Virtuoso
	server to do XSLT transformation on the server side before sending output
	to the client, and after execution of the page.  Hence we will produce
	an XML document.
</para>
  <para>
	After this we need to get the input parameters session_id, query text,
	how many records to skip, and how many records to display.  We do this
	by calling <function>get_keyword()</function> and passing it the 'params' array.
	Every VSP page has <parameter>params</parameter>,
	<parameter>path</parameter>, and <parameter>lines</parameter> as
	input parameters.  For
	each call we supply a default value in case the variable has not been used.  For
	some of the parameters we need an integer, but varchars are always returned,
	so we use <function>atoi()</function> on the result to convert it to an integer.
</para>
	<para>
	Next we retrieve the persistent variables <parameter>user id</parameter> and <parameter>user name</parameter>.  We do this
	by calling <function>connection_get()</function> with the session variable name.
</para>
  <para>
	After this preparation, we are ready to perform the searching by calling the PL stored procedure
	<function>FORI_SEARCH_RES()</function>.  This procedure returns the XML entities that contain
	the results from the search.
</para>
  <para>
	Once we have results, we want to produce the XML document that will be used in the
	XSLT transformation.  We do this part of the work using the shortcuts to the
	<function>http_value()</function> function: '&lt;?= ?&gt;' pairs, and
	also in some places '&lt;?vsp ?&gt;' to call the <function>FORI_SEARCH_FORM()</function> and
	<function>FORI_SEARCH_NAVIGATION()</function> procedures and
	output their results.
</para>
  <para>
	The main benefits to this approach are:
	</para>
	<simplelist>
	  <member>design independency of VSP content: if we need a different design
		we only need to change the XSLT style sheet;</member>
		<member>different style sheets can represent different
		themes.  If we pass an additional 'theme' parameter, for example, we can
		associate a new theme with a different style sheet.  This way we have a fast
		approach to customizing the look of the page;
		</member>
	  <member>browser independence: because we do server-side XSLT transformation
		we do not need the browser to support XSLT or XML at all.</member>
	</simplelist>
  <para>
	If we comment out the line that instructs
	Virtuoso to perform the XSLT transformation (<function>http_xslt()</function>)
	we will get the following document:
</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;page&gt;
&lt;sid&gt;0&lt;/sid&gt;
&lt;usr&gt;anonymous&lt;/usr&gt;
&lt;url&gt;thread.vsp&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;nav_2&gt;&lt;search_form&gt;
&lt;hidden&gt;
&lt;hidden_input type="hidden" name="sid" value="0" /&gt;
&lt;hidden_input type="hidden" name="sk" value="0" /&gt;
&lt;hidden_input type="hidden" name="rs" value="10" /&gt;
&lt;hidden_input type="hidden" name="c" value="0" /&gt;

&lt;option value="mt"&gt;message title&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="mb"&gt;message body&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/search_form&gt;
&lt;/nav_2&gt;
&lt;css_1/&gt;
&lt;squery&gt;&lt;/squery&gt;
&lt;swhat&gt;t&lt;/swhat&gt;
&lt;sskiped&gt;0&lt;/sskiped&gt;
&lt;sresults&gt;10&lt;/sresults&gt;
&lt;scount&gt;0&lt;/scount&gt;

&lt;no_hits/&gt;
&lt;/search_result&gt;

	  <title>Setting up server-side Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with Virtuoso</title>
	  <para>User agents (e.g., Web browsers) have traditionally restricted scripts within web pages by a Same Origin Policy, which allowed scripts to make requests only to resources within the same domain from which the scripts themselves originated. This restriction is meant to protect the user and their computer from "Trojan horse websites" which may appear to be safe, but which then make unsafe HTTP requests to other, invisible sites. This restriction also protects the second website from potential "Denial of Service" and other attacks, whether accidental or intentional.</para>
	  <para>This policy has the unfortunate side-effect of also preventing client-side Web applications served from one website ("Origin") from retrieving data from another website ("Origin").</para>
