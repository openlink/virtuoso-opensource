<sect2 id="rdfviewnorthwindexample1"><title>Simple Mapping Example -- Northwind RDF View</title>
<para>Here is example of the basic Northwind RDF Views deployment. The sequence of operations is very common for adding SPARQL access to existing application.</para>
<para>There exist few important questions to answer. Who should have access to data behind RDF View? Should someone have access to other sorts of RDF data but not to the new View? What are applications that should be interoperable with the new RDF data source? Are there any applications that produce similar data but that data sould be kept apart from data made by view? How to ensure that deployment the view will not cause problems for other applications?</para>
<para>First of all, we decide whether the default web service endpoint should have access to the data in question. If it should then we have to grant SELECT privileges to the account "SPARQL" that is used for the default endpoint; if it should not but some custom edpoint should then grant to the owner account of that account. Granting access is less trivial that it is usual. On one hand, those who can make SQL SELECT statements on application's tables can also make SPARQL queries on RDF View over that tables, because it makes SQL inside. On the other hand, those who do not intend to query that data at all may get unexpected &quot;permission denied&quot; errors on queries that worked fine before adding an RDF View. If SPARQL compiler can not prove that the query can not access data from the view then it will generate SQL code that will access tables behind the view. In some cases permission problems should be resolved by creating RDF View in a separate <link linkend="rdfviewconfiguringrdfstorages">RDF storage</link>. In this example, data are public:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
use DB;

GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Products" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Suppliers" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Shippers" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Categories" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Customers" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Employees" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Orders" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Order_Details" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Countries" TO "SPARQL";
GRANT SELECT ON "Demo"."demo"."Provinces" TO "SPARQL";
]]></programlisting>

<para>Interoperability is the next question. The example is not
interoperable with anything so in can provide data of any form, a real
application will probably use some ontology from external
source. Sometimes data should be converted from internal application's
representation to something different (such as metric to imperial or
ATT country code to two-character country id); sometimes composed IRIs
should follow special rules; <link
linkend="rdfviewiriusingfunction">function-based IRI classes</link>
may help in that cases. As this is the first example, only plain
format-string-based IRI classes are used.</para>

<para>We should also ensure that data generated by the new view will
not be accidentally mixed with other data of the database. For that
purpose the example will use a unique graph name that includes both
application name and host name. In addition, the script will drop
declarations that might remain  from a previous run of the same script. The
script is executed many times during the development so erasing
previous version is worth writing. It will report an error if there's
nothing to erase but it's better than unpredictable errors due to
writing new declarations over existing ones.</para>


<note><para>Making graph name unique for every host is not needed if
the application is supposed to be &quot;local&quot; and nobody will
access more than one installation of the application. If this is
the case, use some fixed graph IRI, not necessarily starting with
hostname at all; this is much more convenient for querying because you
don't have to calculate the graph name in each query. With fixed graph
in use, it is still possible to clone the RDF View to map to a unique
graph as soon as the application become &quot;public&quot; and requires
merging data from many installations.</para></note>

<note><para>The <emphasis>^{URIQADefaultHost}^</emphasis> macro is replaced with the value of <emphasis>DefaultHost</emphasis> parameter of <link linkend="ini_URIQA">[URIQA]</link> section of configuration file. The IRI is written as <emphasis>iri("http://^{URIQADefaultHost}^/Northwind")</emphasis>, not as <emphasis>&lt;http://^{URIQADefaultHost}^/Northwind&gt;</emphasis> because macro of this sort works only inside SPARQL string values.</para></note>

<para>Now it's safe to create IRI classes needed for the view. If
these classes are used only in the view we define then it is safe to
create all of them in a single statement. If some of them are used
across multiple declarations then errors may occur. it is impossible
to redefine an IRI class that is in use; the compiler will try to
avoid reporting errors by checking whether the new declaration is
identical to the existing one and by trying garbage collection in hope
that the IRI class is used only in garbage, but errors may occur
anyway. Thus it is better to declare &quot;shared&quot; IRI classes by
individual statements and group together only &quot;private&quot; IRI
classes of a view. If a &quot;class redefinition&quot; error occurs in
the middle of a group then &quot;undefined class&quot; errors may
occur after because the processing of the group was interrupted before
rest of group was not executed. When in trouble, try <link

-- This view is currently designed to SPECIFICALLY load on data.openlinksw.com. The default URI macro has NOT
-- been used here because it makes no sense on the target box which is actually my.usnet.private:8891 or
-- something similar. If you want to use this view on another box, a simple search-replace should do the trick,
-- but search-replace just`data.openlinksw.com' because http:// is sometimes encoded and you would miss it.
