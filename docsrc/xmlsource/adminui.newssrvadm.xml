  <sect3 id="newsgrpsadm"><title>Conductor Newsgroups Administration</title>
	<para>
	From Conductor the NNTP tab allows you to view and configure Newsgroups associated with the
	Virtuoso News Server.  Like Virtuoso's virtual database, Virtuoso can &quot;link&quot; in
	newsgroups from remote news servers.  This interface allows you to view the
	configuration and control the newsgroups both local and remote.</para>
	<para>
	The Virtuoso News server component will need to be enabled in
	the <link linkend="VIRTINI">Virtuoso.ini</link> file by specifying
	the NewsServerPort number.</para>
	<para>The tab "NNTP Servers" shows list of the registered News servers.</para>

	<para>
	You can also <emphasis>update</emphasis>
	the cache list of newsgroups.  Newsgroup names are (re)fetched in a batch
	background scheduled task.  This is because the list can be very long
	or the connection to the news server could be slow.  The status of the fetch
	is indicated in the grey bar at the foot of the newsgroup list table.</para>
	<para>
	For each newsgroup listed for a news server you can <emphasis>update</emphasis>
	the messages fetched, view and edit the <emphasis>Properties</emphasis> of the
	group, or <emphasis>Remove</emphasis> the group from the list. Also you can get

		<para><emphasis>Server Address</emphasis> is the IP address or hostname of the
		external news server.</para>
		<para><emphasis>Server Port</emphasis> is the port number that the news server

	<sect4 id="newscliui"><title>Viewing Newsgroups</title>
        <para>
        You can view the messages of a newsgroup either using the Conductor UI going to
NNTP/NNTP Servers/News Server/News Group, or using the ODS Framework UI. In the second case you need to
have the ods_framework_dav.vad package and the ods_discussion_dav.vad package installed. Then you can go
from ODS to tab "Discussions" where will be shown the list of available newsgroups. Each one has shown as
link its name, which leads to page where are listed its messages.
