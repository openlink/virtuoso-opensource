This will include the content from the specified url at this point of the page.  The url is relative to the page.
The inclusion will be done before VSPX compile stage, hence the include can contain vspx, HTML or either content.
The only requirement is that the included file be well formed. Note also that if you are using vspx namespace in the include file, it must be declared as such.
