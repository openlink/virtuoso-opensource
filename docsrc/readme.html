<A NAME="instructions" /><H2 CLASS="sect1head">Instructions For Win32</H2>
<P>The XML sources are contained in the xmlsource directory.  
The top level document is virtdocs.xml.  This file must contain a reference for 
all external files that are included in the documentation, this includes chapters,
sections, and functions.  See the relevant section in this document for more 
information about adding content to the documentation.</P>
<P>The documentation can be built from the makehtml.bat script.  
You will firstly need to configure your environment by editing the makehtml.bat 
file and adding a necessary entry for your machine using the others lines as an 
example.  The environment variables %COMPUTERNAME%, and %USERNAME% are 
taken from the normal environment of a Win32 system and can be found by typing 
set in a DOS box.  Multiple environments can be set here per machine/username 
to avoid having to keep versions for different machines in sync.</P>
<P>The batch file can then be run from the command line and 
can take switches.  The more useful ones are:
<PRE CLASS="programlisting">
makehtml mp &lt;chapter_id&gt;
eg: 
makehtml mp quicktours</PRE>
Which lets you render only a chapter of the multipage html output.  This can 
save heaps of time for testing.
</P>
<P>The PDF (and PS) is generated using the HTMLDOC program.  The 
PDF directory contains the file virtdocs_pdf.book which is a configuration file 
that HTMLDOC should use for generating the PDF correctly.  </P>

<A NAME="chaps" /><H2 CLASS="sect1head">Writing Chapters</H2>
<P>New chapters must be included in two places to be made 
visible to the documentation.  Firstly they must be included in the 
virtdocs.xml file in the xmlsource directory, and in order for the new 
chapter to be rendered an entry for the file must be made in the 
chapter_list.txt file of the bin directory.  </P>
<P>The file name and chapter label attribute of new chapters 
must mach exactly.  The id attribute of the new chapter must be the same 
as the label but without the extension.  The entry in the chapter_list.txt file 
then must match the id attribute.  </P>
<P>New chapters begin with the following template: 
<PRE CLASS="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;!-- 
  $Id$
  Copyright (C) 1998-2016 OpenLink Software
--&gt;
&lt;chapter label="TBD.xml" id="TBD"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;TBD&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;abstract&gt;
	&lt;para&gt;TBD&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/abstract&gt;

TBD!

&lt;/chapter&gt;
</PRE>
Where all the TBD's need something.  Use other chapters for examples.
</P>
<P>You will find the entries for other chapters in the virtdocs.xml 
file and chapter_list.txt file.  Use these as examples to add new chapters.  
In the chapter_list.txt file you simply add a new line to the bottom of the list 
with the name of the chapter.  For the virtdocs.xml file you have to add two lines.  
The first line is in the DTD section.  The order of these is not important either, 
so you can make a copy of an existing chapter definition changing the entity name 
and filename reference as appropriate.  Now you need output this entity somewhere 
in the documentation structure.  You will find at the bottom of the virtdocs.xml 
file a list of the all the chapter entities, place yours where you see fit using 
the appropriate "&amp;name;" markup.</P>

<A NAME="funcs" /><H2 CLASS="sect1head">Writing Functions</H2>
<P>There is a template.xml file in the xmlsource/funref 
directory, USE IT!</P>
<P>After a function has been successfully written it must be included 
into the documentation.  You need an entry in the virtdocs.xml file and the 
functions.xml file.  Use the existing entries in these files for examples and 
please try and maintain alphabetical ordering.  Although not required, this just 
makes life easier in the future.</P>

<A NAME="sects" /><H2 CLASS="sect1head">Writing Sections</H2>
<P>Adding text to an existing section is a no brainer, use the 
existing document content for examples.  If you are adding new sections 
(sect[12345]'s) it may be suitable to add a new file and include this in the 
relevant chapter if the topic is long and isolated.  There are many examples of 
this such as the wsdl.xml file, which is a section included in the webservices.xml 
file.  Sections must have an entity definition in the virtdocs.xml file like 
chapters do but the entity is not output in that file!  That means you include a:
<PRE CLASS="programlisting">
&lt;!ENTITY wsdl	 		SYSTEM "wsdl.xml"&gt;</PRE>
line but the &amp;name; goes in the chapter, not the top level.</P>
<P>Be very careful of correct nesting.  Make sure that if your 
new section is a sect1, it must be output in a chapter.  Likewise a sect2 inside 
a sect1...</P>

<A NAME="gen" /><H2 CLASS="sect1head">Writing General Content</H2>
<P>Try and stick to the 
<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/docbook.html">DocBook</A> 
DTD.</P>
