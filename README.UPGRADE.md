Virtuoso Open Source Upgrade Notes
==================================

*Copyright (C) 1998-2019 OpenLink Software <vos.admin@openlinksw.com>*

Introduction
------------

Always make  sure the database has been properly shutdown and the
transaction log (virtuoso.trx) is empty before performing any of the
following updates/upgrades.

Before upgrading any database, it is always a wise precaution to make
a proper backup.


Upgrading from VOS 5.0.X to VOS 5.0.Y
-------------------------------------

The database format has not changed between various versions of Virtuoso
5.0.X, so from a database standpoint no particular steps need to be
performed before upgrading to the latest version of Virtuoso 5.

The only requirement is that you have properly shutdown the database
prior to installing the latest binaries, as the transaction logs can
have a different version tag. In this case the virtuoso server will
print the following message and refuses to start the database:

    The transaction log file has been produced by server version
    '05.00.XXXX'. The version of this server is '05.00.YYYY'. If the
    transaction log is empty or you do not want to replay it then delete
    it and start the server again. Otherwise replay the log using the
    server of version '05.00.XXXX' and make checkpoint and shutdown
    to ensure that the log is empty, then delete it and start using
    new version.


Upgrading from VOS 5.0.X to VOS 6.1.0
-------------------------------------

The database format has substantially changed between these two versions
of Virtuoso. To upgrade your database, you must dump all your data from
your VOS 5.0 database and re-load it into VOS 6.0.

Regular VOS 5.0 RDBMS tables can be dumped with the dbdump tool into
scripts that can be replayed using the isql tool into the VOS 6.0
database.

For VOS 5.0 RDF_QUAD table, we have a set of dump/load stored procedures
to dump graphs into a set of backup files, which can then be reloaded
into the VOS 6.0 database. Contact us at <vos.admin@openlinksw.com>
for more info.

If you attempt to start a VOS 5.0 database with a VOS 6.0 server, the 
server will print the following message ans refuses to start the
database:

    The database you are opening was last closed with a server of
    version 3016. The present server is of version 3126. This server
    does not read this pre 6.0 format.



Upgrading from VOS 6.0.0(-TP1) to VOS 6.1.0
-------------------------------------------

The database disk format has not changed, but the introduction of a newer
RDF index requires you run a script to upgrade the RDF_QUAD table. Since
this can be a lengthy task and take extra disk space (upto 2x space of
original RDF_QUAD table during conversion) this is not done automatically
on startup.

After upgrading the binary you cannot perform any SPARQL queries until
the new RDF_QUAD table is installed. The steps for this are:

  1. Shutdown the database and verify .trx file is empty

  2. Check to make sure you have enough disk space to perform operation

  3. Check to make sure you have a proper backup of the database

  4. Edit virtuoso.ini and disable VADInstallDir and possibly the
     HTTPServer section for duration of the upgrade.

  5. Start up the database

  6. Connect with isql to your database and run the libsrc/Wi/clrdf23.sql
     script. Depending on the number of quad records this can take
     several hours. Once the conversion is complete, the database 
     will shutdown itself.

  7. Edit virtuoso.ini and enable VADInstallDir and possibly HTTPServer
     section

  8. Start up database


Upgrading from VOS 6.1.X to VOS 6.1.Y
-------------------------------------

The database format has not changed between various versions of Virtuoso
6.1.X, so from a database standpoint no particular steps need to be
performed before upgrading to the latest version of Virtuoso 6.1.x.

The only requirement is that you have properly shutdown the database
prior to installing the latest binaries, as the transaction logs can
have a different version tag. In this case the virtuoso server will
print the following message and refuses to start the database:

    The transaction log file has been produced by server version
    '06.01.XXXX'. The version of this server is '06.01.YYYY'. If the
    transaction log is empty or you do not want to replay it then delete
    it and start the server again. Otherwise replay the log using the
    server of version '06.01.XXXX' and make checkpoint and shutdown
    to ensure that the log is empty, then delete it and start using
    new version.


Upgrading from VOS 6.1.X to VOS 6.1.4
-------------------------------------

In Virtuoso versions before 6.1.4 some XML data was stored in the
QUAD store in such a way it could break the sequence in an index
causing wrong results to be passed back.

To fix this we've added an automated check into 6.1.4 to detect if
this condition occurs and to fix the index when needed.

When a DBA starts the database with this newer virtuoso binary the
following text will appear in the virtuoso session log:

  21:05:36 PL LOG: This database may contain RDF data that could cause indexing problems on previous versions of the server.
  21:05:36 PL LOG: The content of the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table will be checked and an update may automatically be performed if
  21:05:36 PL LOG: such data is found.
  21:05:36 PL LOG: This check will take some time but is made only once.

This check will take some time depending on the number of stored
QUADS, but if the check succeeds the following message is entered
in the log and virtuoso will flag this check is done, so it will
not affect subsequent restarts of the database server. 

  21:05:36 PL LOG: No need to update DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD

The database will continue to perform the startup routines and go
into an online state.


However if the condition is detected, the following message will
appear in the log and the virtuoso server will refuse to start up:

  21:05:36 PL LOG: An update is required.
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG: NOTICE: Before Virtuoso can continue fixing the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table and its indexes
  21:05:36 PL LOG:         the DB Administrator should check make sure that:
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG:          * there is a recent backup of the database
  21:05:36 PL LOG:          * there is enough free disk space available to complete this conversion
  21:05:36 PL LOG:          * the database can be offline for the duration of this conversion
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG:         Since the update can take a considerable amount of time on large databases
  21:05:36 PL LOG:         it is advisable to schedule this at an appropriate time.
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG: To continue the DBA must change the virtuoso.ini file and add the following flag:
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG:     [Parameters]
  21:05:36 PL LOG:     AnalyzeFixQuadStore = 1
  21:05:36 PL LOG:
  21:05:36 PL LOG: For additional information please contact OpenLink Support <support@openlinksw.com>
  21:05:36 PL LOG: This process will now exit.

Since the update will take a substantial amount of time and additional
disk space depending on the size of the QUAD store, OpenLink has
decided not to automatically start the update process but hand
control back to the DBA and let him decide when to perform this
update. In case the DBA wants to delay the update until a more
appropriate time, he should restart with the previous binary as
this latest binary will not allow him to startup.

Once the DBA has checked the backups, disk space and found an
appropriate time-slot to run this update, he should edit the
virtuoso.ini file and add the following flag:

	[Parameters]
	AnalyzeFixQuadStore = 1



Upon starting the virtuoso server, the following messages will appear in the virtuoso.log file:

  21:05:57 PL LOG: This database may contain RDF data that could cause indexing problems on previous versions of the server.
  21:05:57 PL LOG: The content of the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table will be checked and an update may automatically be performed if
  21:05:57 PL LOG: such data is found.
  21:05:57 PL LOG: This check will take some time but is made only once.
  21:05:57 PL LOG:
  21:05:57 PL LOG: An update is required.
  21:05:57 PL LOG: Please be patient.
  21:05:57 PL LOG: The table DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD and two of its additional indexes will now be patched.
  21:05:57 PL LOG: In case of an error during the operation, delete the transaction log before restarting the server.

  21:10:20 Checkpoint started
  21:10:22 Checkpoint finished, log off

If the update process detects any problem, it will put some debug
output into the virtuoso.log and exit. At this point the DBA is
advised to remove the virtuoso.trx file and contact OpenLink Support
<support@openlinksw.com>.

After the update process has completed, the database is left in an online state.
