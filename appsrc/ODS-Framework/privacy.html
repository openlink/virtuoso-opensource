	      <h1>ODS Privacy Statement</h1>

	      <p>Here at OpenLink Software, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and so you can understand the way your information is collected and used.</p>

	      <p>OpenLink treats personal information that OpenLink DataSpace (ODS) collects and receives, including information related to your blog, news, mail and other services ODS provides. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, phone numbers, geographic local, ICQ, Skype and photos, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

	      <h2>How we use Collected Information</h2>

	      <ul>
		  <li>
		  ODS collects personal information when you register with ODS, when you use ODS products (blog, news, mail) or services, when you visit any pages or the pages of other members.</li>
		  <li>When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with ODS and log in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
		  <li>ODS automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.</li>
		  <li>ODS uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the services and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal use.</li>

	      </ul>
	      <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

	      <p>OpenLink Software does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>

	      <ul>
		  <li>OpenLink provides information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with OpenLink or ODS under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help ODS communicate with you about offers from OpenLink Software, ODS or our partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
		  <li>OpenLink responds to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
		  <li>OpenLink believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ODS terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
		  <li>OpenLink may transfer information about you if ODS is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, OpenLink will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>OpenLink works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please read any of the help or reference links on any of our pages.</p>

	      <h2>Children's Privacy:</h2>

	      <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

	      <h2>Data Security</h2>

	      <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. In addition, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>

	      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

	      <p>OpenLink Software (ODS) reserves the right to update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your ODS account or by placing a prominent notice on home page. </p>
