       dealings in the software.                                                   
       
       This  software is  available under the  three different licenses  mentioned 
       below.  To use this software you must chose, and qualify, for one of those. 

       The WebFX Non-Commercial License          http://webfx.eae.net/license.html 
       Permits  anyone the right to use the  software in a  non-commercial context 
       free of charge.                                                             

         The WebFX Non Commercial license only applies if all of the following
         statements are true and not broken.
         
            1. The header in the P/C (1) may not be removed or modified.
            2. The P/C is used in a non-commercial or non-profit environment (2).
                  1. No money is put into the environment except the cost of the
                     web space and domain name.
                     You may of course also put money into hardware and software
                     that run the environment.
                     This means that no one can get paid to maintain the
                     environment.
                     No company, organization or institute can back up the
                     environment financially. Non-profit organizations (3) are
                     excluded.
                  2. The environment that the P/C is used in cannot make any
                     profit.
                     This means that you cannot sell anything, directly or
                     indirectly using the environment.
                     You cannot use the P/C in an environment that act as a
                     promotion/commercial for a commercial product.
                     Commercial banners can be used as long as the income from
                     these does not exceed the cost to maintain the environment.
                     Donations are allowed.
            3. The P/C may be freely modified as long as 1 - 2 are not broken.
               Any work based on the P/C also fall under this license.
               This means that if you base any work on the P/C then the new
               product cannot be used commercially.
            4. The P/C may be freely distributed as long as 1 - 3 are not
               broken.
               This means that the P/C cannot be redistributed to any third
               commercial part because this would break 2.
               This also means that if the P/C is included in a widget pack
               (component library) then the widget pack (or parts of it that
               uses the P/C) may not be used in a commercial environment.
         
         (1) P/C - product/component provided by WebFX.
         (2) Environment - Program that uses the product/component. This
             includes web sites, intranets and offline programs.
         (3) Non-profit organization - a non-profit organization is a
             organization that has no intention of making money in any way and
             all work is done for charity.

       The WebFX Commercial license           http://webfx.eae.net/commercial.html 
       Permits the  license holder the right to use  the software in a  commercial 
       context. Such license must be specifically obtained, however it's valid for 
       any number of  implementations of the licensed software.                    

         The WebFX Commercial License permits the inclusion of the products for
         which a license has been obtained (hereby referred to as the products)
         in any current or future product produced by the license holding
         corporation (hereby referred to as the corporation) with the exception
         of the following product-types:
         
             * Individual or combined sale of the products as a stand-alone
               offer.
             * Individual or combined sale of the products as part of a
               components package or web development aid.
         
         The products may be included simply as enhancements to another product.
         The products may be included simply as a part of another product. The
         corporation may never profit directly from sale of the products, only
         from the application they are included in. All intellectual property
         rights and source code right will remain in the possession of WebFX and
         the affected author.
         
         The products may not be resold. Neither may products deviated from the
         original code, or products produced by reverse engineering the original
         code, be sold or in any other way be profitable for the corporation.
         If The products are included in a service offered by the corporation a
         license must be obtained for each company the service is sold to.
         
         The license is valid only for the products and only for the purchased
         version of those, with the following exceptions.
         
             * Minor updates.
             * Major updates released within one (1) month of the purchase.
             * The product has been discontinued and replaced by another product
               within one (1) month of the purchase.
         
         A minor update consists of bug fixes and patches that may include some
         enhancements and small, added features to the product. Minor updates
         are signified by minor version number changes. For example, a minor
         update from version 3.0 would be 3.1 or 3.01).
         
         A major upgrade consists of major enhancements and new features added
         to the product. Major upgrades are signified by a major version number
         change. For example, a major upgrade from version 3.0 would be 4.0.
         
         The corporation is entitled to a free update, if one or more of the
         above criteria are met. Updates not addressed above requires a new
         license, which can be purchased at rebated price if the old one is
         revoked.

       Permits anyone the right to use and modify the software without limitations 
       as long as proper  credits are given  and the original  and modified source
