ISQL/ISQLODBC  --  Interactive SQL client shell for KUBL DBMS


VERSION HISTORY:

The original bare-boned version (isql.c): Orri Erling

From the version 0.972b (since January 1997) onward developed
by Antti Karttunen.

This program is also used for reading in SQL-files produced
by DBDUMP.

Changes, from January 1997 onward

Version 0.972b: implemented first versions of new features, like

* Printing correctly blob and date/timestamp columns.

* The first rudimental versions of foreach, set, show and load commands.

* Commands TABLES, COLUMNS, PRIMARYKEYS, STATISTICS, etc. calling
the corresponding SQL-API-functions.

* Counting of the bracelevel of procedure definitions.


02-MAR-1997 AK  Corrected print_error.
03-MAR-1997 AK  Added FOREACH TIMESTAMP for testing timestamp params.
Cleaned few help texts (foreach and set).

20-MAR-1997 AK  Version changed from 0.973b to 0.974b
25-MAR-1997 AK  Added gnu readline routine thanks to a
tip from Han Holl. (should be compiled with
HAVE_READLINE defined in Linux)
Added also FOREACH item BETWEEN form
mainly for testing purposes.

26-MAR-1997 AK  Added spawning-possibility, i.e. if the input line
ends with the ampersand (&) instead of the normal
semicolon (;) then an asynchronous subprocess of
this same executable is spawned that should run the
statement(s) specified on that line. The statements
to be executed are given to the new subprocess
with the EXEC= option, and if there are more than
one statement they are separated with semicolons.

ISQL-command WAIT_FOR_CHILDREN will suspend the
execution of the parent process until all spawned
children have finished.

Corrected parse_statement_for_special_parameters
and count_bracelevel to take heed of the new
possibility of escaping singlequotes also with
backslash. Added also semicolon marking to
count_bracelevel to serve the new possibility
of executing multiple statements with one EXEC= option.
(See the note about spawning above.)

28-MAR-1997 AK   Moved read-eval-print loop from the end of main function
to its own function, called rep_loop. Now load command
will call it by default, unless the option -r is specified
in which case the old load_raw routine is used which
can be applied only to procedure definitions.

Also, when reading with rep_loop (interactively from user
or with load command without -r option) and
CREATE PROCEDURE or TRIGGER definition is encountered
which doesn't end with semicolon it is now sent to
server anyway.

New ISQL-commands ECHO and NOP. An empty line followed
by semicolon is also now ignored (not sent to server).
Added get_next_token macros like $RETVAL, $RETVALLEN,
$ROWCNT, $EQU, $NEQ and $IF with which it is possible
to write conditional ISQL-commands, so helping us
to write test-scripts with isql itself.

E.g. a command like following is legal, and will print
"nautajauheliha" followed by newline:

echo $if $equ 3 3 $if $equ 4 5 "sika" "nauta" "mursu" "jauheliha\n";

Also following works:

$IF $NEQ $RETVAL "FOU" EXIT ECHO "Assertion passed RETVAL=" $RETVAL "\n";

But this DOESN'T work:

$IF $EQU $RETVAL "FOU" ECHO "Assertion passed RETVAL=" $RETVAL "\n" EXIT;

(Which means that we need later a real IF-STATEMENT
with THEN, ELSE and FI keywords, as well as few other
real shell features like GOTO, WHILE,
SET EXIT ON ERRORS LIKE "4*", whatever...)

Note that these haven't been documented yet, and their
usage might slightly change later, so use with caution.

15-APR-1997 AK   Corrected the eating of SET PASSWORD and SET USER GROUP
commands, which are now sent to server as they should.

18-APR-1997 AK   New $-macros $STATE and $MESSAGE for SQL error state
checking, and $ARGV[$I] for argument passing from
command line.

19-APR-1997 AK   Made error messages more informative in regard to
in which file, at which line they occurred, with the
new system of load expression and linecount stacks.
(See macro current_linecount() and functions
push_to_loadexpr_stack and drop_from_loadexpr_stack)

It's now possible to overwrite ARGV vector elements
with SET ARGV[n] 'newvalue'  command.
Together with a new $-macro $+ (plus) it can be used
for keeping counts of passes and failings of tests, etc.
(Yes, it's a crude attempt at user variables and
leaks memory a little with each new strdup which is
not currently freed anywhere.) Now (29-APR-97) it is,
see G_argv_touched.

21-APR-1997 AK   Renamed get_next_keyword to get_next_token

24-APR-1997 AK   Version changed to 0.976b because of the following
changes:

Changed isql_exit(-1) to isql_exit (2) when losing
connection, because IF ERRORLEVEL 1 doesn't detect
the exit code -1 in Windows NT MS-DOS shell.
SO! Always use only exit codes 0 (success) and
1 (generic failure), 2 (Lost line, 08S01) or
3 (could not connect to) when exiting from isql !!!
(should be #defined somewhere indeed...)

Added fclose(in_fp) to isql_foreach after statements
like: FOREACH item IN filename
has been executed.

Modified field_print so that it now avoids any
unnecessary padding with blanks on the right side
if the column to be printed is the rightmost one.
Because of that, added inx argument to field_print
and print_datetime_col

Made load_raw (actually do_statement that it calls)
to return more civilized error-message when something
is screwed: instead of showing whole procedure
definition twice it will now show procedure definition
once and then the procedure name if it was specified.
(Well, actually the first procedure definition of
error message is included in the error message
that is got from Kubl server.)

Modified EXIT statement so that EXIT NOT is NO-OP,
allowing statements like:

EXIT $IF $EQU $ARGV[0] 10 $+ 50 $ARGV[0] NOT;

which exits with exit code 60 if $ARGV[0] is ten
(presumably keeping a somekind of failure counter)
but otherwise does nothing special, and continues
from the next statement. (Real IF-statement is
needed again...)

Implemented deadlock retry counter tentatively
(new variables perm_deadlock_retries and
vol_deadlock_retries, ISQL-command SET DEADLOCK_RETRIES
modified print_error function and IF_SEVERE_ERR_GO).
Currently has any effect only with
FOREACH statements if SET DEADLOCK_RETRIES is
explicitly set to non-zero value.

Splicing of EXEC= option created by spawn_to_background
before the -i option (if it is present), so that it
will have any effect in the daughter process.


02-MAY-1997       Started doing a WEB-interface, taking pieces from
old W3SQL, whose Windows version is more or less
in deep freeze now.


03-MAY-1997       Version changed to 0.977b

Added n+1 casts between unsigned char * and char *
(using macros SCP and UCP) to make code C++ compilable.

Added the command SET ACCESSMODE RO/RW.

The $dollar_form substitution implemented in the
function parse_statement_for_special_parameters
which may now destructively modify its string argument.
See comment in the beginning of function exec_one.

Changed spawnv to spawnvp (Windows), and execv to execvp
(Unix), so that spawning commands to background
will find isql from anywhere in the path.

14-MAY-1997       Version changed to 0.978b
IMPORTANT CHANGE: Now the connection is done in the
delayed way, that is, only after a command is
encountered that really needs a database connection.
This allows specifying DSN, USERNAME and
PASSWORD, as well as HTTP content type used with
the commands SET DSN=, SET UID=,
SET PWD=, and SET CONTENT_TYPE= in the beginning
of the loaded ISQL file.
However, if the datasource (possibly together with
username and password) has been given from the
command line in traditional way (that is: not with
equal signs as DSN=Kubl, but just as Kubl)
then the connection is established almost immediately
in the beginning, as was the case before this version,
so this should not break any existing test suites.

Added also LOAD= option, for explicitly specifying
from the command line the file(s) to be loaded.

Wrote isql_exit as its own function (not just as macro)
that will do things like writing command history
(if compiled with HAVE_READLINE in Linux),
SQLShutdown (if connected to server) and
terminating HTML page clearly with proper tags
(if in Web mode, and content_type is "text/html")
before finally exiting.

Expressions like $LAST[$ARGV[$I]] work correctly now,
because of proper counting of nested brackets
with the new function find_closing_point.

Implemented associative array U for User and URL
variables. Additions to get_next_token and
is_set_subcommand.

get_next_token now cuts tokens to first
opening or closing brace/bracket/parenthesis/angle
bracket, as well as to comma, that is, all of the
{ }, [ ], ( ) and < >, will be
returned one token (of one character) per time.

Started major streamlining of get_next_token
by tabulating all more or less regular $ dollar-macros
into the table isql_variables with the macro
add_var_def. Implemented the rest of comparison
macros, $LT, $LTE, $GT and $GTE at the same time.

This streamlining needs to be extended into
is_set_subcommand also, e.g. so that it will
use the same table-scanning function as
get_next_token, both for showing and setting.
(mostly done now).

The return values of get_next_token should be cleansed
e.g. special token_null for NULL's, and token_error
for syntax errors, etc.

Needs to be done: Finishing deadlock retry counter.

Cleaning up the code for C++ compilation.
(Mostly done 3-MAY-1997, by adding SCP and UCP casts).

Dividing this source file to separate modules.

Checking for any minor strdup memory leaks.

Collecting all the global variables into somekind
of a structure (that would passed around in stack),
so as to make code more re-entrant, in anticipation
for the eventual multi-threaded implementation.

BULK-parameters for foreach statement.

And output parameters for procedures, e.g.
call FOU(?,?Oout_param1<2000>)
would allocate a buffer of 2000 plus one bytes,
assign a new (or old???) user variable named out_param1
to it, and bind that as the second, output parameter
of the procedure call to function FOU.
Then it would be possible to say echo $out_param1
Not that way, instead call FOU(?,?>2000U{newout})
or FOU(?,?2000>U{newout}) ? or FOU(?,?2000U{newout}) ?
Anyway, it would allocate a new 2000 bytes long
of user-variable called newout (if one didn't exist
already, in which it would be used instead), and
then bind it as output variable before continuing.

Also, dollar form $:name which were like $name
but would automatically wrap the result in single
quotes unless it evaluates to NULL.

More fancy options for FOREACH (see comments before
isql_foreach) allowing to build all kinds of loops
(e.g. non-?-parameterized version of FOREACH, calling
exec_one each time.)
and for reading in text files formatted in various ways
(e.g. CSV), maybe also something like
FOREACH name, value OF U call something(?,?); ???


Adding more $-macros, like $OR, $AND,
$LIKE and all the sundry others.

Implementing real IF THEN ELSE FI command, GOTO,
SET EXIT ON ERRORLEVEL '2*', and whatever else is
needed.

Substituting of $dollar_forms in SQL-statements
themselves (done now, see above), and/or implementing
?$ -parameters for foreach.
(The whole concept requires rethinking).

Ability to execute multiple statements (lines)
in one transaction. E.g. form like:
TRANSACT { statement1;
statement2;
statement3;
etc;
} -- Transaction ends here.
Or maybe just special commands:
TRX_BEGIN; and TRX_END; ?

Documentation.

Misgivings:       This program seems to become a yet another shell-like
interpreted programming language, of which there
are already more than enough in this world.
Building a really good ODBC-api into some existing
tool language (e.g. Perl, Python, or even gawk, csh
or bash) might be a better idea after all, provided
that language/shell/tool is easily available on all
platforms. But anyway, it's a handy tool (when finally
documented)!

11-JUN-1997  AK   Version now 0.980b
Added options TRAILING_NEWLINES=0 & BINARY_OUTPUT=ON
for the exact outputting of contents of blob columns.
Use them together with options VERBOSE=OFF BANNER=OFF
(possibly also PROMPT=OFF) and of course BLOBS=ON
to fetch a blob column just as it was originally
inserted into the database.

25-JUN-1997  AK   Added call to SQLRowCount in show_results and
exec_for_foreach.
SQLRowCount is now implemented with wiodbc.dll
version 1.05b, Kubl version 0.96b G14d3.
show_results needs a thorough cleaning anyway.
Version changed to 0.981b

09-JUL-1997  AK   Added second argument to push_to_loadexpr_stack
(which is the next current input stream used by load)
effecting that now FOREACH item
without the IN keyword reads the following items
(lines or blobs) always from the same source as
where the FOREACH statement itself was read from,
not stupidly from stdin as was case before.
This form of FOREACH doesn't yet work with
Webgate, when FOREACH statement is in EXEC-option.

21-AUG-1997  AK   Squashed an insidious bug in field_print which
caused numbers in the rightmost fields to be omitted
from the output. (Also, the TMPBUF_SIZE has been
grown to 560 to avoid crashings with certain test
procedures.)

11-SEP-1997  AK   Corrected the sleep command in the Windows version.
Hadn't realized that Sleep requires milliseconds,
not seconds, so now the argument is multiplied by
thousand. Version changed to 0.984b.

12-SEP-1997  AK   Added a spawning-possibility of shell-commands with !
(Added a new function spawn_shell_command).
Added also a Forced Load feature, which checks in
the beginning of main that if this program is started
with a name containing an underscore then the part
after an underscore is used as a filename (suffixed
with .sql) which is automatically loaded in as a
first file. By giving EXIT; as a last command in that
file the administrator can make sure that nothing else
is done with isql than what is specified in that file.
This is an useful feature for allowing certain
specific operations to be run by the public via the Web.

14-NOV-1997  AK   Version 0.9845b
Improved RFC1867 HTML file-upload receiving.
(Still to be extensively checked).
Now correctly escapes singlequotes and all other
problematic characters (e.g. newlines, backslashes)
when doing $-prefixed ISQL-variable substitutions
inside string literals (i.e. singlequotes) in SQL
statements that are to be sent to the server.
Improved function show_results so that it now
will dynamically increase the size of column's
result buffer in case the new precision of column
is greater than the previously allocated size.
Tried to compile the program with SQLCLI headers
(sqlcli.h, sqlicli2.h and odbc2cli.h) instead
of Microsoft's sql.h and sqlext.h. Made some
changes for that.

07-DEC-1997  AK   Version 0.9846b. Doesn't bind blob columns anymore,
unless BLOBS=OFF (print_blobs_flag is zero.)

26-JAN-1998  AK   Version 0.9847b
Added SQL_SCOPE_TRANSACTION and SQL_SCOPE_SESSION
to SpecialColumns commands
(used instead of default SQL_SCOPE_CURROW when
option /t or /s is present with /b).

/* SQL standard allows also C-like multiline comments like this.
   Maybe we should check for those also?
   Note that this function, as well as the previous,
   parse_statement_for_special_parameters function should be modified
   accordingly, now that Kubl will soon allow
   also backslash escape sequences in strings.
   E.g. with the new system '\'' is "'" and '\\' is "\" is pain in the
   ass. So we have to know which system we are using.
   Not really, implemented 26-MAR-1997 easily by just adding a
   simple case clause for the backslash.
   Added also two more arguments, scivec (semicolon index vector)
   and maxsemicols which is its maximum size.
   scivec will hold the one-based indices to semicolons present in
   the str, or optionally if its is given as NULL pointer, then nothing
   is tried to store there. Indices are one-based so that the end of them
   can be marked with a terminating zero.

   Note the similarity with the previous function which collects
   parameter-markers and has to avoid strings and comments as well.

   Modification 14-MAY-1997: Added two parameters:
   chars_watched which should be a string two characters, e.g. "{}"
   if we are counting braces, or "[]" if brackets, or "()" if parentheses,
   or "<>" if angle brackets.
   and return_index_instead_of_level, which if non-zero, tells this
   function to return, instead of the final bracelevel, the one-based
   index to the point where the corresponding closing character
   of the same level was found (that is, where bracelevel plunged
   back to the zero.) or zero if no matching closing character were
   found.
   The old functionality is accessible with the following macro.

   Here's the catch when reading in line_by_line mode:
   There has to be a possibility to present exactly, by DBDUMP,
   0) a NULL in blob column, i.e. value that is not really a blob at all,
   but NULL is NULL is NULL.
   1) an empty blob (of 0 bytes)
   2) as well as a blob whose last line doesn't end with newline.

   The NULL in the blob column is presented just as
   FOREACH BLOB INSERT INTO BLOBS(BLOB) VALUES(NULL);

   Without the END keyword!

   The empty blob is presented just as
   FOREACH BLOB INSERT INTO BLOBS(BLOB) VALUES(?);
   END

   The blob whose last line doesn't end with a newline is presented as:
   FOREACH BLOB INSERT INTO BLOBS(BLOB) VALUES(?);
   The first line
   \END the second line which just happens to begin with a string END
   The third line, that ends with a period, not a newline.\c
   END

   So we use here a new magical escape sequence \c that just cuts
   the string short at that point, leaving the newline dangling
   in the input buffer out.
   (See function unescape_string)

   In dbdump.c the function print_blob_col (not the one in this source file!)
   produces lines that can be read with this function in line_by_line mode.

/* An excerpt from ODBC API help file,
   function SQLTransact(henv, hdbc, fType)
   (Affects how we implement deadlock retrying...)

   If fType is SQL_COMMIT, SQLTransact issues a commit request for all
   active operations on any hstmt associated with an affected hdbc.
   If fType is SQL_ROLLBACK, SQLTransact issues a rollback request
   for all active operations on any hstmt associated with an affected hdbc.
   If no transactions are active, SQLTransact returns SQL_SUCCESS with no
   effect on any data sources.

   If the driver is in manual-commit mode (by calling SQLSetConnectOption
   with the SQL_AUTOCOMMIT option set to zero,
   i.e. in ISQL SET AUTOCOMMIT OFF, which is OFF by default), a new
   transaction is implicitly started when an SQL statement that can
   be contained within a transaction is executed against the current data
   source.

   To determine how transaction operations affect cursors, an application
   calls SQLGetInfo with the SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR and
   SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR options.

   If the SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR or SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR value
   equals SQL_CB_DELETE, SQLTransact closes and deletes all open cursors on
   all hstmts associated with the hdbc and discards all pending results.
   SQLTransact leaves any hstmt present in an allocated (unprepared) state;
   the application can reuse them for subsequent SQL requests or can call
   SQLFreeStmt to deallocate them.

   If the SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR or SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR value
   equals SQL_CB_CLOSE, SQLTransact closes all open cursors on all hstmts
   associated with the hdbc. SQLTransact leaves any hstmt present in a
   prepared state; the application can call SQLExecute for an hstmt
   associated with the hdbc without first calling SQLPrepare.

   If the SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR or SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR value
   equals SQL_CB_PRESERVE, SQLTransact does not affect open cursors
   associated with the hdbc. Cursors remain at the row they pointed to
   prior to the call to SQLTransact.

   For drivers and data sources that support transactions, calling
   SQLTransact with either SQL_COMMIT or SQL_ROLLBACK when no transaction
   is active will return SQL_SUCCESS (indicating that there is no
   work to be committed or rolled back) and have no effect on the data
   source.

   Drivers or data sources that do not support transactions (SQLGetInfo
   fOption SQL_TXN_CAPABLE is 0) are effectively always in autocommit mode.
   Therefore, calling SQLTransact with SQL_COMMIT will return SQL_SUCCESS.
   However, calling SQLTransact with SQL_ROLLBACK will result in SQLSTATE
   S1C00 (Driver not capable), indicating that a rollback can never be
   performed.

   end

   Where TYPE is either a line, integer or blob.
   If the keywords FOLLOWING or IN filename is omitted after type, then
   the following is the default.
   If escaped/nonescaped is omitted, then escaped is the default.
   (except when reading from a file)

   In the future may read comma-separated values (CSV?)

   foreach INTEGER, STRING, FLOAT, INTEGER IN filename insert

   And something like this: (Needs good regexp parser? Or use string.c)

   foreach NONESCAPED BLOB IN mailfile STARTED_BY 'From:* '
   insert into mails(mail_id,from_line,mail) values(?C,?S,?);

   ?S will be a new special parameter referring to the starting line of a
   multiline blob, bound as a normal VARCHAR string. That first line is
   also included in the blob itself. (If using instead the SEPARATED_BY
   keyword, then the line which matched to it, is not included.)

   SEPARATED_BY 'END*' (* default *)


   foreach LINE NOT LIKE '#*' insert ...

   foreach WORD, REST ON LINE NOT LIKE '#*' insert ...

   Other kind of loops also:

   foreach TABLE LIKE 't%' DROP TABLE %s;
   foreach SYSTEM TABLE ...
   foreach VIEW LIKE ...

   foreach DIRECTORY LIKE '*'
   foreach FILE LIKE '%s/ *.blob' -- %s would refer here to directory names
   --                                generated by the first foreach part.
   -- And not until in this last part they would refer to filenames itself:
   foreach BLOB IN %s insert into blobtable(filename,blob) values(%s,?);

   What about, something like:

   foreach integer between $I $- $ARGC 1 create table \$ARGV[?](a integer, etc.);

   Probably we should use a more civilized syntax, something like ?D and ?F
   etc...

   It must be noted that Content-Type values, subtypes, and parameter

   parameter values are case-sensitive unless otherwise specified for
   the specific parameter.

   So this means that in many cases we really should use nc_strstr
   (defined in ../string.c) instead of isqlt_tcsstr !!!

   It is possible to completely screw up the input to CGI-script with
   HTML-constructs like this, which at least Netscape version 2.02E
   will send without any escaping...

   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="LUMIKRME&#34;Lismake&LT;=&GT;kima&#59;ra&AMP;lahna" VALUE="Suikkaboksi limisesti huikkaa!">
   <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="sikaniska-NAME=lumiukko filename=pena" VALUE=RASTITTU>

   like these:
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="LUMIKRME"Lismake<=>kima;ra&lahna"
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="sikaniska-NAME=lumiukko filename=pena"

   A line with real filename= parameter should look like this:

   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="KUVA1"; filename="D:\InetPub\wwwroot\imagemap\soyombo.gif"

   So we assume that the users won't write forms with doublequotes
   in parameter names, and neither they should use spaces.
