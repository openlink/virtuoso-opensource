-- Test for concurrent insertions, version two, using automatic timestamp
-- primary key. By AK 31-MAR-1997.

echo BOTH "STARTED: Concurrent inserts with timestamp key\n";

drop table iutest;
create table iutest(num integer,txt varchar,ts timestamp,primary key(ts))
alter index iutest on iutest partition (ts varchar);

-- Spawn two isql's to background each to insert ten thousand and one items:
CONNECT; SET AUTOCOMMIT=ON; FOREACH INTEGER BETWEEN 100001 110000 insert into iutest(num,txt) values(?,'Proc1'); insert into iutest(num,txt) values(1,'Proc1 Last') &
CONNECT; SET AUTOCOMMIT=ON; FOREACH INTEGER BETWEEN 200001 210000 insert into iutest(num,txt) values(?,'Proc2'); insert into iutest(num,txt) values(1,'Proc2 Last') &

-- But run the third insertion from this isql, not in background:
SET AUTOCOMMIT=ON;
FOREACH INTEGER BETWEEN 300001 310000
  insert into iutest(num,txt) values(?,'Proc3');
insert into iutest(num,txt) values(1,'Proc3 Last');
SET AUTOCOMMIT=OFF;

-- Then wait for all wee children to finish
WAIT_FOR_CHILDREN;

-- And sleep one second more as WAIT above might not be perfect...
SLEEP 1;

-- We can clear the passed and failed counts only after the spawning:
SET ARGV[0] 0;
SET ARGV[1] 0;

-- Before checking the count, which should be 30003:
select count(*) from iutest;
ECHO BOTH $IF $EQU $LAST[1] 30003 "PASSED" "***FAILED";
SET ARGV[$NEQ $LWE "PASSED"] $+ $ARGV[$NEQ $LWE "PASSED"] 1;

select count (*) from tn;
ECHO BOTH $IF $EQU $LAST[1] 4000  "PASSED" "***FAILED";
