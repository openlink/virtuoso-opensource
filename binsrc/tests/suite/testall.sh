#  This test suite can be also run under Windows NT if you have GNU WIN32
#  package.
#  See URL http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/ where you can download
#  it from. This has been tested with version b18. It is enough
#  to download usertools.exe, which is about four and half megabytes long
#  self-extracting archive.  Remember also to do the post-installation
#  settings mentioned in http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/readme.html
#  (E.g. you have to configure your Windows NT PATH).
#
#  If you unzip this package with an old PKUNZIP that converts
#  the filenames to uppercase, you should first run the script
#  lowerall.sh that will reconvert them back to lowercase, before
#  starting this one.
#
#  Note that in when running in Windows NT the environment variable
#  OSTYPE should be defined as win32 (done automatically by the shell)
#  that this worked correctly.
#  (Similarly, on Unix platforms it should be anything else except win32)
#
#  Keep the PORT as 1111 unless you want problems. In Windows NT this
#  assumes that there exists a previously defined Virtuoso datasource
#  with the name 'Virtuoso' whose host:port is set to localhost:1111
#
#
#  Yet needs to be done:
#
#  A) Exhaustive testing of all SQL syntactic features. (E.g. string literals
#     with various escape characters and conventions for single quotes,
#     empty strings, etc.)
#
#  B) Of all SQL statement features (e.g. inserts, updates, deletes, select,
#     where-expressions and joins not encountered in twords.sql)
#     Could be added to twords.sql or twords2.sql, using the existing
#     words data.
#
#  C) Of all built-in bif SQL-functions (documented in funrefs.doc)
#
#  D) Test of procedures written with Virtuoso/PL SQL Procedure language
#
#  E) ODBC/SAG CLI API-calls, e.g. various catalog calls. (Tables, Procedures,
#     TablePrivileges and ColumnPrivileges have already been partly tested in
#     tsec*.sql)
#
#  F) Singular cases. E.g. empty tables (tested in tdbdump.sql),
#     empty whatevers, etc.
#
#  G) Testing the functionality of isql itself.
#
#  H) On Win32 platforms, running some of the tests also with isqlodbc,
#     not only with isql, thus testing also the ODBC driver functionality.
#     (The DBDUMP used in tdbdump.sh is compiled as an ODBC application
#     in Win NT, so that script partly tests also the ODBC driver.)
#
#
#  If you add your own tests, see the test suites run from tsec.sh (tsec.bat),
#  i.e. tsec*.sql as they are the most pedantically written, checking almost
#  everything.
