<title>Creating a collation</title>
<para>
The collations are stored into the SYS_COLLTIONS system table.
A collation can be created by supplying a &quot;collation definition&quot; text file to
the &quot;collation_define&quot; SQL function.  The collation definition file contains a list of
the &quot;exceptions&quot; to the binary collation order represented with the character
code = collation weigth pairs.  For example a case insensitive collation can be defined by specifing
all the lower case letters to have the same collation weigths as the corresponding uppercase ones.
</para>
<sect2 id="coldeffile">
<title>Collation definition file</title>
<para>
The format of the collation definition file should follow the following guidelines:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem><para>Each definition should reside on a separate line.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The format of the definition is: CHAR=CODE, where CHAR and CODE an be either the
letters themselfs, or their decimal codes. (Example : 67=68 is equal to C=D using the ASCII character
set). Not that the codes can exceed the byte boundry (for Unicode collations).
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect2 id="coll_defiine">
<title>coll_define SQL Function</title>
<programlisting>
collation_define (COLLATION_NAME, FILE_PATH, ADD_TYPE)
</programlisting>
<para>
COLLATION_NAME is the name to be assigned to the collation.
</para>
<para>
FILE_PATH is the path (in the server&apos;s OS) of the collation definition file.
</para>
<para>
ADD_TYPE is the type of the new collation: 1 for 8-bit collation (256 bytes blob); 2 for UNICODE collation
(65536 unicode blob).  There is a special value of 0 for that parameter instructing the function to only
check the validity of the definition file and to return a resultset containing the codes of the valid exception
definitions.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sys_collations">
<title>Collations system table</title>
<para>
The SYS_COLLATIONS system table holds the data for all the defined collations. It has the following structure:
</para>
<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE SYS_COLLATIONS (
    COLL_NAME VARCHAR,
    COLL_TABLE LONG VARBINARY,
    COLL_IS_WIDE INTEGER);
</programlisting>
<para>
COLL_NAME is the fully qualified name of the collation (it&apos;s identifier)
</para>
<para>
COLL_TABLE holds the collation table (256 bytes or 65536 wide chars)
</para>
<para>
COLL_IS_WIDE show the collation&apos;s type (0 for CHAR and 1 for NCHAR). Note that a 8bit collation
cannot be used by a NCHAR data and vice verca.
</para>
<para>
Collation can be deleted by deleting it's row from SYS_COLLATIONS. Note that the collation will be
still available until restarting the server, as it's definition is cached into memory.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="8BIT">
<title>8 bit characters</title>
<sect2 id="collation">
<title>Collations</title>
<para>
Virtuoso supports collation orders different from the binary for CHAR and VARCHAR fields as per ANSI SQL-92.
</para>
<para>
When comparing strings using a collation Virtuoso compares the &quot;weigths&quot; of the characters
instead of their codes.  This allows making different characters compare like equal (example:
case-insensitive comparisons).
</para>
<para>
The collation is a property of the column holding the data. This means that all the comparisons including
that column will use it&apos;s collation. Note that the SQL functions will strip the collation data from the
column (example : if a Column &quot;CompanyName&quot; has an assigned collation &quot;Spanish&quot;
then LEFT (CompanyName, 10) will use the default collation).
</para>
<para>
The collation can be defined per column (on table creation) and per database (as a configuration parameter).
There is a user-accessible collation definition procedure.
There is a special form of the CAST operator witch allows casting a column to collation.
</para>
<para>
A collation identifier has the same form as any other SQL identifier (qualifier.owner.name) and it can be
escaped as the other identifiers.
</para>
<sect3 id="tablecoll">
<title>Defining collation for a table column</title>
<para>
The collation for a column is assigned on table creation using the following syntax:
</para>
<programlisting>
create table TABLE_NAME (
...
COLLATED   VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Spanish,
COLLATED   CHAR(20) COLLATE DB.DBA.Spanish,
....
)
</programlisting>
<para>
Note that assigning a collation to a non-character column gives an error.
</para>
<para>
If the COLLATE is ommited, the the default database collation is used.
</para>
<para>
On database start-up the collation for each table's collumn is looked into the SYS_COLLATIONS TABLE
and if not found, the COLLATE attribute is ignored until the next restart.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="dbcoll">
<title>Defining database wide collation</title>
<para>
The database&apos;s default collation is defined by the configuration parameter &quot;Collation&quot; in
the &quot;Parameters&quot; section of virtuoso.ini
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="16bit">
<title>Unicode characters support</title>
<para>
Virtuoso allows 16-bit Unicode data to be stored and retrieved from the database fields.
The data are stored internally as UTF-8 encoded strings for storage space optimization.
The unicode fields are easily intermixable with other character data as all the SQL functions
support wide string case and convert to the most wide character representation on demand.
</para>
<sect2 id="datatypes">
<title>Unicode data types</title>
<para>
There are 3 additional data types to enable storing of Unicode data
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem><para>NCHAR</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>NVARCHAR</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>LONG NVARCHAR</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
All the unicode types are equivalent of the corresponding &quot;narrow&quot; type (CHAR,
VARCHAR and LONG VARCHAR), except that instead of storing data as one byte they allow
unicode characters. Their lengths are defined and returned in characters instead of bytes.
They collate according to the active wide char collation (if any).
Thease types can be used anywhere the narrow char types can be used, except in LIKE conditions.
</para>
<para>
When there is a need to convert a wide string to a narrow one and vice verca, then a character set is
used.  A character set returns a wide string code for a wide char. For example there can be a definition of
ISO-8859-5 &quot;narrow&quot; character set witch describes mapping of NON-ASCII character codes
to their unicode equivalents.  Virtuoso relies on the fact that the ASCII character codes are represented
in Unicode by just type-casting and in UTF8 as one-byte tokens with the same value as in ASCII.
</para>
<para>
When conversion is done server-side (using cast, some of the SQL built-in functions, etc.) the wide
characters are converted to narrow using a system-independant server-side character set. In it&apos;s
epsence the Latin1 character set is used which project narrow character codes into the Unicode space
as equaly-valued wide character codes.
</para>
<para>
Things are different when the conversion is done client-side (for example when binding a VARCHAR to a
wide buffer).  Then the default client's system character set is used.
</para>
<para>
The wide character literals have the ANSI SQL-92 syntax  : N&apos;xxx&apos; (prefixing normal literals
with the letter N).  Thease strings process escapes with a values large enough to represent all the
Unicode characters.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="widefunc">
<title>Built-in SQL fucntions and wide characters</title>
<para>
All the built in SQL functions witch do take a character attribute(s) and do have a character input are
calculating their output type as follows:
</para>
<para>
If there is any attribute witch is a wide string or a wide blob, then the result is a wide string. Otherwise the output character type is narrow.
</para>
<para>
There are some functions, like make_string, witch do have character result type, but don&apos;t have a
character parameters. This is resolved by leaving the make_string to produce narrow strings, and
providing a make_wstring equivalent for wide output.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="wideodbc">
<title>Client-side changes to support wide characters</title>
<para>
The ODBC client implements the SQL...W functions (like SQLConnectW) that do take unicode arguments.
This contributes to a faster wide character processing and allows binding of SQL_C_WCHAR output type.
As the SQL parser doesn&apos;t allow unicode data in SQL commands, they should be bound as parameters
or should be represented as escapes.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="nvdb">
<title>Virtual database and national language support</title>
<para>
For narrow strings attached tables are using allways the default collation of the data source.
</para>
<para>
Remote wide string columns are mapped to the appropriate wide character type in Virtuoso.
The data are then passed as intact in case of wide-to-wide mapping. When the data are converted
client-side in the VDB the Server's system character set is used (where avaliable).
