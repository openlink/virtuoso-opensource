			<title>Non incremental snapshot replication</title>
			<para>
The Virtuoso periodically evaluates a query and inserts the result into a table,
replacing the content. The source and target can be anywhere but typically will
be on different databases of which at least one is remote.
</para>
			<para>
Note that this makes a two party distributed transaction. Only one of the transaction
branches is writing, hence this goes with a one phase commit.
</para>
			<para>
Note that this can be used to replicate between two non-Virtuoso databases.
</para>
			<para>
The prerequisite of this mode of replication is that all tables exist.
The schema is never replicated.
</para>

		<sect2 id="SNLOG">
			<title>Table snapshot logs</title>
			<para>
In order to be able to create incremental snapshots on a table there should be
a snapshot log table defined in the following fashion :
</para>
			<programlisting>
create table RLOG_sourcetable (
RLOG_sourcetable_primarykey_parts,
...
SNAPTIME DATETIME,
DMLTYPE	 CHAR(1),
PRIMARY KEY (RLOG_*));
</programlisting>
			<para>
The name of the snapshot log table is constructed from the name of the source table by
prefixing it with RLOG_ .
</para>
			<para>
Snapshot log table contains all the primary key parts of the source table prefixed with RLOG_ .
</para>
			<para>
Snapshot log table contains at most one row per updated source table row with the update time
and update type in DMLTYPE (I - for insert, U - for update, D - for delete).
</para>
			<para>
There should be triggers on the source table to update the log like that :
</para>
			<programlisting>
create trigger xxx_I_log after insert on xxx {
		insert replacing RLOG_xxx values (xxx_pk, now(), 'I'); }
create trigger xxx_D_log after delete on xxx {
		insert replacing RLOG_xxx values (xxx_pk, now(), 'D'); }
create trigger xxx_U_log after update on xxx {
  		if (OLD.xxx_pk differs from NEW.xxx_pk)
    	{
      		insert replacing RLOG_xxx values (OLD.xxx_pk, now(), 'D');
      		insert replacing RLOG_xxx values (NEW.xxx_pk, now(), 'I');
    	}
  		else
    		insert replacing RLOG_xxx values (xxx_pk, now(), 'U');
}
</programlisting>
			<para>
where xxx is the source table name, RLOG_xxx is the snapshot log table name, xxx_pk is a comma separated list
of the source table's primary key parts. The names of the triggers are constructed from the fully qualified name
(DB.DBA.Orders makes DB_DBA_Orders_I_log).
</para>

		<sect2 id="INC">
			<title>Incremental snapshot replication</title>
			<para>
A table can be replicated from a generic, possibly non-Virtuoso source in an
incremental fashion if the data source meets certain criteria:
</para>
			<para>
The data should come from a single table.
</para>
			<para>
The source table should have an explicit primary key.
</para>
			<para>
There source query should have the form
</para>
			<programlisting>SELECT fields FROM source_table WHERE scalar_conditions
</programlisting>
			<para>
A snapshot log on the source table should exist.
</para>
			<para>
The should be insert, delete and update triggers on the source table to update the snapshot log.
</para>
			<para>
The incremental update is done in the following way:
</para>
			<para>
All the changed records with a snaptime greater or equal from SN_LAST_TS are processed.
If the record to insert allready exists, then it's updated. If the record to update doesn't
exist in the destination table, then it's inserted. This contributes for conflict resolving.
</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="SYSTABLES">
			<title>Replication system tables</title>
			<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE SYS_SNAPSHOT (
    SN_NAME	VARCHAR(255),
    SN_QUERY    VARCHAR(1024),
    SN_LAST_TS	VARBINARY(30),
    SN_IS_INCREMENTAL	INTEGER,
    SN_SOURCE_TABLE	VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (SN_NAME))
</programlisting>
			<para>
This table describes all defined snapshot replication relations.
SN_NAME is the snapshot's name (destination table name). SN_QUERY is the query to get the data from.
SN_LAST_TS is the time of the last update reflected for incremental snapshots (from the snapshot log's SNAPTIME).
SN_IS_INCREMENTAL is null for nonincremental snapshots and non-null for the incremental ones.
SN_SOURCE_TABLE is the source table for the incremental snapshots, NULL otherwise.
</para>
			<para>
This implies that an incremental snapshot can be updated in two ways - incrementaly and nonincrementaly
as the nonincremental definition is a subset of the incremental definition.
</para>

				<title>CREATE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>CREATE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_create_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Creates a snapshot log of a native (non VDB) table and the appropriate log update triggers.
</para>
				<para>
Note that when replicating data from a remote Virtuoso a snapshot log table can be created on the
remote virtuoso and then the source and log tables can be attached into the local Virtuoso. However
the snapshot log table and the update triggers should be created manually on a non-Virtuoso data source.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
create snapshot log for Orders;
</programlisting>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="DROPLOG">
				<title>DROP SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>DROP SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_drop_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Drops a snapshot log of a table and the log update triggers.
</para>
				<para>
This results in 4 SQL commands :
</para>
				<programlisting>
drop trigger xxx_I_log;
drop trigger xxx_U_log;
drop trigger xxx_D_log;
drop table RLOG_xxx;
</programlisting>
				<para>
where xxx is the source table name (fully qualified - DB.DBA.Orders becomes DB_DBA_Orders).
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
drop snapshot log for Orders;
</programlisting>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="PURGELOG">
				<title>PURGE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</title>
				<programlisting>PURGE SNAPSHOT LOG FOR source_table</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_purge_snapshot_log(in source_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
There can be old snapshot log rows witch have been replayed in all the snapshots of a given source table.
Thease rows are no longer needed and can be purged from the snapshot log for a faster operation.
</para>
				<para>
This command checks if there are any rows in SYS_REPLICATION reffering to that source table and if there
are, then it deletes all the rows in the log table with SNAPTIME earlier then MIN(SN_LAST_TS).
</para>
				<para>
If there are no rows in SYS_SNAPSHOT it asumes that the log is used for "pull" replication
and doesn't do anything.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
purge snapshot log for Orders;
</programlisting>

				<programlisting>CREATE NONINCREMENTAL SNAPSHOT dest_table as 'query_def'</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_create_snapshot(in query_def varchar, in dest_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Creates a non-incremental snapshot log of the data returned by the query query_def.
</para>
				<para>
The server first checks for the existance of a table with the same name. If it doesn't exist,
then a table with a layout to accomodate the resultset produced by query_def is created.
</para>
				<para>
Then a entry containing query_def and tablename is added to SYS_SNAPSHOT and the destination table
is filled in with an insert into tablename query_def.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
<programlisting>create nonincremental snapshot sub_orders as
		'select * from Orders where OrderID &lt; 5'
</programlisting>

				<programlisting>repl_create_inc_snapshot(
    in source_column_list varchar,
    in source_table varchar,
    in condition varchar,
    in dest_table varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Creates a incremental snapshot log using source query like that :
</para>
				<programlisting>
SELECT source_table_pk_cols, source_column_list FROM source_table WHERE condition
</programlisting>
				<para>
If the dest table allready exists, then it's column count is checked tobe greater than the
primary key parts count of the source table.
</para>
				<para>
If the source_column_list is ommited, then the destination table is created to have the same
columns as the source table.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
CREATE SNAPSHOT sub_orders FROM Orders WHERE 'OrderID &lt; 5'
</programlisting>

			<sect3 id="UPDATESNAP">
				<title>UPDATE SNAPSHOT</title>
				<programlisting>UPDATE SNAPSHOT snapshot_table_name [ AS NONINCREMENTAL ]</programlisting>
				<programlisting>repl_refresh_inc_snapshot(

				<programlisting>repl_refresh_noninc_snapshot(
    in snapshot_table_name varchar)</programlisting>
				<para>
Without the optional argument updates the snapshot according to it's type.
If an incremental snapshot needs to be updated as a nonincremental, then the full form should be used.
</para>
				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>
UPDATE SNAPSHOT sub_orders
</programlisting>

				<para>
Examples (based on Virtuoso demo database):
</para>
				<programlisting>

	<!-- ======================================== -->
	<sect1 id="SCHEDULER">
		<title>Virtuoso scheduler</title>
		<para>
Virtuoso scheduler allows an arbitrary SQL command to be run at sertain intervals.
</para>
		<para>
The scheduler process wakes up every n minutes, scans the SYS_SHCEDULED_EVENT table and
executes each command witch applies to the current time. Note that overdue commands are executed
only once.
</para>
		<para>
There is a virtuoso.ini parameter "Scheduler interval" under "Parameters" section witch defines
the scheduler wake-up interval. Set this to 0 (the default) to disable the scheduler.
</para>
		<sect2 id="SYSTABLES">
			<title>SYS_SCHEDULED_EVENT</title>
			<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE SYS_SCHEDULED_EVENT(
    SE_NAME		varchar,
    SE_START		datetime,
    SE_SQL		varchar,
    SE_LAST_COMPLETED	datetime,
    SE_INTERVAL		integer,
    PRIMARY KEY(SE_NAME));
</programlisting>
			<para>
This table describes each scheduled SQL command. SE_NAME is the name of the scheduled event.
SE_START is the first schedule execution time.
SE_SQL is the text of the SQL command to be executed.
SE_LAST_COMPLETED is the last time when the SQL command was executed successfully.
SE_INTERVAL is the interval between the runs of the SQL command in minutes.
</para>
			<para>
Defining a new scheduled event means adding a row to the SYS_SCHEDULED_EVENT with an insert statement like this:
</para>
			<programlisting>
INSERT INTO SYS_SHCEDULED_EVENT (SE_NAME, SE_SQL, SE_START, SE_INTERVAL)
		VALUES (.....)
