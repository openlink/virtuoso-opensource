<title>SQL Procedure Language Guide</title>
<abstract>
<para>
Stored procedures are a key component of database performance.
The fewer messages are sent between the client and the server for a
given transaction, the faster it will complete.
</para><para>
Virtuoso/PL is a simple and straightforward language for writing stored
procedures and triggers in Virtuoso.  Its syntax is a combination of SQL
and C, making learning it as easy as possible. It offers the features
commonly found in database procedure languages in a simple, efficient
and concise package. This document presents the primary concepts of the
language and ends with a reference section
</para>
</abstract>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="GENERALPRINCIPLES">
<title>General Principles</title>

<para>
A stored procedure is a named piece of Virtuoso/PL code stored in the
SYS_PROCEDURES table. Stored procedures are created with the create
procedure statement and are used by executing a procedure call statement
through the regular SQL API.
</para><para>
A procedure takes zero or more arguments and optionally returns a value.
Procedure arguments may be either input, output or input and output.
In this manner a procedure may modify a variable passed to it by its
caller. If the procedure is called from a call statement executed by
a client process, the client process gets back the procedure&apos;s return
value and the values of output parameters.
</para><para>
Procedures have local variables and cursors that are not visible to
other procedures. Procedures can call each other without limitations,
including recursively.
</para><para>
In addition to returning a value and changing values of output parameters
a procedure may yield one or more result sets. The client can receive
rows in result sets just like rows returned by a select statement.
A procedure calling another procedure cannot receive a result set
produced by the called procedure, however. While parameters and return
values work equally well between procedures as between procedure and
client application, a result set always goes to the client, even if the
procedure has been called by another procedure.
</para><para>
A procedure consists of statements and expressions similar to those of any
procedural language. In addition, procedures may contain SQL statements
operating on the procedure&apos;s arguments and local variables. Writing a
stored procedure is thus much like using embedded SQL in C, except that
a stored procedure is typically much faster.
</para><para>
The elements of the procedure are:

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">

</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="SCOPEOFDECLARATION">
<title>Scope of Declarations</title>

<para>A declaration can appear anywhere inside a compound statement. It affects
all statements in the compound statement following the declaration
statement.
</para><para>
A declaration also affects statements outside the declaring statement if
those are textually after the declaring statement. This is a kludge and
may be removed in a later version. Code should be written only counting
on declarations affecting following statements in the containing compound
statement.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="DATATYPES">
<title>Data Types</title>

<para>
Virtuoso/PL supports the regular SQL scalar data types. Virtuoso/PL
does not presently support any actual data structures other than the
relational tables of the database. Local temporary tables are not
supported by the present Virtuoso but may be added in the future.
</para><para>
Memory management is automatic. Parameters, cursors and intermediate
results are automatically allocated and freed.
</para><para>
A parameter or variable can be of any data type a column can. Variables
are however typed at run time, so that the declared type is mostly for
documentation. The declared types also affects how interactive SQL
shows certain values.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="RESULTSETS">
<title>Handling Result Sets</title>

<para>A single Virtuoso procedure may produce multiple result sets, each
with different result columns. A normal procedure produces one empty
result set, only returning a possible return value and values of output
parameters to the application.
</para><para>
The result_names, result and end_result SQL functions allow sending
result rows to the application from a Virtuoso/PL procedure.
</para>

<programlisting>
	CREATE PROCEDURE RES (IN I INTEGER)
	{
	    DECLARE STR, STR2 VARCHAR;

	    RESULT_NAMES (I, STR);
	    RESULT (I, &apos;FIRST&apos;);
	    RESULT (I + 1, &apos;SECOND&apos;);
	    RESULT_NAMES (I, STR, STR2);

	    END_RESULT ();

	    RESULT (I, &apos;FIRST&apos;);
	    RESULT (I + 1, &apos;SECOND&apos;);
	    RESULT (I + 2, &apos;THIRD&apos;, &apos;FF&apos;);
	    RESULT (I + 3, &apos;FOURTH&apos;, &apos;FF&apos;);

	    RETURN 1;
	}
</programlisting>

<para>
The res procedure returns two result sets, the first with 2 rows and
the next with 4.
</para><para>
The result_names function gives each result column a type and title which
can be shown by interactive SQL. This can be omitted if the application
knows which columns to expect. The result function sends the actual result
row. The end_result function indicates that a new result set will begin.
These functions can be used inside loops or subprocedures, thus allowing
one call to yield a variable number of result sets.
</para><para>
The result_names function is called before the end_result at the end of
the first set to let the client know the composition of the next result
set in advance. If the new set were not introduced before the previous
was ended isql could not show the correct columns and would assume the
same column names and types as for the first set. Again, if the client
application were coded to accept certain results in a certain order this
would not be needed.
</para><para>
You may look at the source of isql for an example of receiving multiple
result sets.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="ARRAYS">
<title>Result Sets and Array Parameters</title>

<para>
A procedure may be called with array parameters,
c.f. SQLParamOptions. Each call can yield multiple result sets.
</para><para>
The SQLMoreResults function is used to get from one result set to the
next and from one procedure call to the next. One may have to call this
function an indeterminate number of times before all results from a
procedure with array parameters have been received.
</para><para>
Each procedure return is marked with SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO with SQL state
&apos;PMORE&apos;. The next SQLFetch will retrieve the first row of the first
result set of the next procedure invocation.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="EXCEPTIONS">
<title>Exception Semantics</title>

<para>
Exceptions are of two types: Not Found and SQLSTATE. A not found
exception occurs when a select - into or open statement finds no row or
when a fetch statement reads past the last row of a cursor. A SQLSTATE
exception may result from any operation, typically a manipulative
SQL statement. The SQLSTATE &apos;4001&apos;, deadlock is an example of this.
A user-written procedure may signal a user defined exception with the
signal function.
</para><para>
The only form of exception handling supported by Virtuoso(PL is the
whenever statement. This specifies that the procedure will transfer
control to a specific label if any statement textually following the
whenever statement produces the exception mentioned in the whenever
statement.
</para><para>
An unhandled exception will cause the procedure where it is detected to
return the exception to its caller. If the caller is another procedure
that has a handler for the specified exception that procedure transfers
control to the handler label. If the caller is a call statement issued
by a client, the client gets the SQLSTATE and the SQLExecute function
called by the client returns SQL_ERROR and the client application may
retrieve the SQLSTATE and message with the SQLError function.
</para><para>
A SQLSTATE is any short string used to identify an error or exception
condition. The system itself generates certain predefined SQLSTATE&apos;s
for error conditions. Applications may add other states.
</para><para>
See the whenever statement and signal function for an example of
exception handing.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="PROCEDURES_TRANSACTIONS">
<title>Procedures and Transactions</title>

<para>
A procedure call executed by a client is just like any other SQL
statement. It executes in the context of the client&apos;s active transaction.
If the connection is in autocommit mode the transaction is automatically
committed if the procedure returns successfully and rolled back if
the procedure returns with an error. If the connection is in manual
commit mode, a possible procedure error has no effect on the client&apos;s
transaction, unless the error is a transaction error, e.g. timeout
or deadlock.
</para><para>
Virtuoso/PL procedures themselves cannot commit or roll back
transactions. This may be changed in a future release.
</para><para>
For best performance, we recommend to use procedures in autocommit
mode. In this way, a single client-server exchange will suffice to carry
out the whole transaction. This will also conveniently roll back the
transaction if the procedure exited as a result of an unhandled SQLSTATE
or a &apos;not found&apos; condition.
</para><para>
If the connection or invoking client statement is in a historical read
mode (SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY or SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER), procedures can be used
but possible modifying statements (insert, update, delete) will cause
an error.
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="DEBUGGING">
<title>Debugging and Program Development Loop</title>

<para>
The client-server nature of stored procedures makes debugging them less
interactive than programs in general. There is no single step mode and
stack traces are not available. On the other hand, procedures are not
intended for building complex applications but for streamlining usually
straightforward transaction profiles.
</para><para>
To follow execution of a procedure you may either have it print diagnostic
messages or send diagnostic results. You may always use interactive SQL
to look at what changes a procedure has made to a database.
</para><para>
If the server is running on a Unix platform and you have access to the
console where it was started (i.e. the server process&apos; standard output)
you can use the dbg_printf and dbg_obj_print functions to print out
diagnostic messages. If you do not have access to the server&apos;s output or
are running under Windows NT, the diagnostic messages are not available.
</para><para>
All platforms however support sending result sets and using interactive
SQL. This is the preferred way of debugging procedures.
</para><para>
Procedure source code can be written into an ASCII file with any
programming editor. The C indentation rules supported by many text
editors will work fine with Virtuoso/PL code.
</para><para>
In a typical program development situation you can use three windows:
One with interactive SQL, one for editing the code and the third for
periodically loading the code into the database.
</para><para>
Although create procedure statements can be issued from isql or any
application programs, the most convenient way of loading procedures is
the batch mode of isql. This is invoked by:
</para>

<screen xml:space='preserve'>
isql data-source user password file
</screen>

<para>
The data source is host:port under Unix and the ODBC data source name
under Windows. the file should be a text file with create procedure
statements and SQL commits only, just like a source file in any
programming language.
</para><para>
Immediately after a file has been loaded the procedures can be tested
from interactive SQL or application programs.
</para><para>
When dealing with result sets in interactive SQL, remember to use the
&apos;call procedure (argument) form of the call statement. The call keyword
tells isql to show all result sets.

<para>A trigger is a means of attaching an action expressed in procedure
language to a database operation such as an insert, update or delete.
Triggers are useful for enforcing integrity rules, maintaining the
validity of data computed from other data, accumulating history data etc.
</para><para>
A trigger is a procedure body attached to a table and an event,
i.e. update, insert or delete. A trigger can take effect before, after
or instead of the event on the subject table. Several before, after
of instead of triggers may exist for a given event on a given table.
In this case the order of activation of the triggers can be specified
with the ORDER clause.
</para><para>
A trigger body has no arguments in the sense a procedure does. A trigger
body implicitly sees the columns of the subject table as read-only
parameters. An update trigger may see both the new and old values of
the row of the subject table. These are differentiated by correlation
names in the REFERENCING clause.

Triggers are capable of cascading, i.e. the code of a trigger may cause
another trigger to be activated. This may lead to non-terminating
recursion in some cases. Triggers may be turned off either inside a
compound statement or inside a connection with the SET TRIGGERS OFF
statement.
</para><para>
An update trigger may have a set of sensitive columns whose update will
cause the trigger code to be run. Update of non-sensitive columns will
not invoke the trigger. If no column list is specified any update will
invoke the trigger. The REFERENCING clause allows specifying a correlation
name for new and old values of columns. By default, the new values are
seen under the column names without a correlation name. If old values
of updated columns are needed, the REFERENCING OF AS &lt;alias&gt;
will make &lt;alias&gt;.&lt;column&gt; refer to the old value.

Triggers have a name which is unique inside each qualifier / owner
combination. The trigger name is relevant only for the purpose of
dropping triggers.

<title>FOR Statement</title>

<programlisting>
&lt;for statement&gt; ::=
     FOR &lt;query exp&gt; DO statement
</programlisting>

<para>
The FOR statement provides a compact notation for iterating over the result
set of a cursor.  The body is executed once for each row in the query expression&apos;s result set.
The result columns produced by the query expression are accessible as variables of the same
name inside the body.  All result columns do therefore have to be named with the AS declaration
if they are not simple columns, in which case the name defaults to the column&apos;s name.
</para><para>
The body can be exited in mid loop with a goto. The cursor of the FOR does not
have to be specifically closed or opened.  FOR statements can be freely nested.
If a WHENEVER NOT FOUND declaration is in effect before the FOR it will be canceled
by it, so that it is not in effect after the loop&apos;s body.

<title>Triggers and Virtual Database</title>

<para>
Triggers may be defined on tables residing on remote databases. The
semantic of triggers is identical but will of course only take place when
the manipulation takes place through the Virtuoso defining the triggers.
Trigger bodies may reference remote tables just as any other procedure
bodies can. Note that triggers can be used for replication, i.e. one may
define a local change to be mirrored to a remote table using a trigger.
</para><para>
Consider an application with a warehouse supplying orders. There is a
total value of all orders kept at the warehouse level and there is the
total value of all order lines kept at the order level. When an order
line is added, both the order value and consequently the total order
value are updates. These values are maintained for insert, update and
delete of order line. On the other have, when an order is deleted,
all corresponding order lines must be deleted.

These rules are maintained with the below set of triggers.

<para>The SET statement sets an option to a value. Options may control trigger
invocation, transaction isolation and other settable parameters of
the engine. A SET inside a procedure takes effect inside the procedure
and invoked procedures, counting from time of execution.  Control must
pass through the SET statement for it to take effect, i.e. SET is not
a declaration. The effect of a SET does typically not persist across
procedure return.

A SET given at top level, i.e. directly executed ad by a client as the
statement of a SQLExecute sets an option at the connection level. This
