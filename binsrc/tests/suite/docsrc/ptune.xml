<title>Optimizing Disk I/O</title>
<para>
Virtuoso allows splitting a database over several files that
may be on different devices.  By allocating database fragments onto
independent disks I/O performance in both random and sequential database
operations can be greatly enhanced by judicious use of multiple disks.
</para><para>
The basic unit of a database is the segment. A segment consists of an
integer number of 4K pages.  A segment may consist of one or more files called
stripes. If a segment has multiple stripes these will be of identical
length and the segment size will be an integer multiple of the stripe size.
</para><para>
The individual files composing a database are limited to 2GB of length.
Splitting a database over several segments allows database sizes of up to
16384 GB (32 bit page number with 4KB per page). O
</para><para>
When a segment is striped each logically consecutive page resides in a different
file, thus for a segment of 2 stripes the first stripe will contain
all even numbered pages and the second all the odd numbered pages. The
stripes of a segment should always be located on independent disks.
</para><para>
In serving multiple clients that do random access to tables the server can
perform multiple disk operations in parallel, taking advantage of the independent
devices. Striping guarantees a statistically uniform access frequency to all
devices holding stripes of a segment.
</para><para>
The random access advantages of striping are available without any specific configuring
besides that of the stripes themselves.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="IOQS">
<title>Configuring I/O queues</title>
<para>
Striping is also useful for a single client doing long sequential
read operations.  The server can detect the serial nature of an operation, for
example a count of all rows in a table and can intelligently prefetch rows.
</para><para>
If the table is located in a striped segment then the server will read all
relevant disks in parallel if these disks are allocated to different I/O queues.
</para><para>
All stripes of different segments on one device should form an I/O queue.
The idea is that the database stripes that benefit
from being sequentially read form a separate queue. All queues are then read and written
independently, each on a different thread. This means that a thread
will be allocated per queue. If no queues are declared all database files, even if located
on different disks share one queue.
</para><para>
A queue is declared in the striping section by specifying a stripe
id after the path of the file.
</para>

<programlisting>
[Striping]
Segment1 = 200M, (disk1/db-seg1-1.db iq1, (disk2/db-seg1-2.db iq2
Segment2 = 200M, (disk1/db-seg2-1.db iq1, (disk2/db-seg2-2.db iq2
</programlisting>

<para>
In the above example the first stripes of the segments form one queue
and the second stripes form another. This makes sense because now all database files
on /disk1 are in iq1 and all on /disk2 are on iq2.
</para><para>
This configuration could have resulted from originally planning a 200 MB database
split on 2 disks and subsequently expanding that by another 200 MB.
</para><para>
The I/O queue identifier can be an arbitrary string. As many background I/O threads
will be made as there are distinct I/O queues.
</para><para>
Striping and using I/O queues can multiply sequential read rates by a factor almost
equal to the number of independent disks.  On the other hand assigning stripes on one disk
to different queues can have a very detrimental effect. The rule is that all that is physically
accessed sequentially will be on the same queue.
</para>

<sect1 id="SCHEMAS">
<title>Schema Design Considerations</title>

<sect2 id="DataOrg">
<title>Data Organization</title>
<para>
One should keep the following in mind when designing a schema for
maximum efficiency.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="Clustering">
<title>Clustering</title>
<para>
If two tables are often joined in an equijoin they should be clustered
together, i.e.  in the same cluster or clustered by value. Say the ORDERS
table had a primary key of ORDER_NO and the ORDER_ITEMS table had a
primary key of ORDER_NO, PRODUCT_CODE, both keys should be clustered
by value, causing the order items to physically follow the order's
main record.
</para><para>
Clustering also results in better locking behavior.
</para><para>
A table that is clustered by value should never be read from end to end
without search criteria since this requires scanning through the whole
database. A table that does need to be read from end to end without
criteria should always have at least one contiguous index, i.e. one that
is not clustered by value.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="IndexUsage">
<title>Index Usage</title>
<para>
A select from a table using a non-primary key will need to retrieve the
main row if there are search criteria on columns appearing on the main row
or output columns that have to be fetched from the main row. Operations
are noticeably faster if they can be completed without fetching the main
row if the driving key is a non-primary key. This is the case when search
criteria and output columns are on the secondary key parts or primary
key parts. Note that all secondary keys contain a copy of the primary
key. For this purpose it may be useful to add trailing key parts to a
secondary key.	Indeed, a secondary key can hold all the columns of a row
as trailing key parts. This slows insert and update but makes reference
to the main row unnecessary when selecting using the secondary key.
</para><para>
A sequential read on the primary key is always fastest.  A sequential
search with few hits can be faster on a secondary key if the criterion
can be evaluated without reference to the main row. This is because a
short key can have more entries per page.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="SpaceConsump"><title>Space Consumption</title>
<para>
Each column takes the space `naturally' required by its value. No field
lengths are preallocated.  Space consumption for columns is the following:
</para>

<screen>
Data				Bytes

Integer below 128		1
Integer below 256		2
long				5
float				5
timestamp			8
double				9
string under 256 chars		2 + characters
longer strings			5 + characters
NULL				1
BLOB				5 + n times 4K
</screen>

<para>
Each key has an overhead of 6 bytes for under 256 bytes per entry and 9
for longer. This applies to the primary key as well as any other keys. The
length of the concatenation of the key parts is added to this. For the
primary key the length of all columns are summed. For any other key the
lengths of the key parts plus any primary key parts not on the secondary
key are summed.
</para><para>
In light of these points primary keys should generally be short.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="PageAlloc">
<title>Page Allocation</title>
<para>
For data inserted in random order pages tend to be 3/4 full. For data
inserted in ascending order pages will be about 90% full due to a
different splitting point for a history of rising inserts.
</para>
