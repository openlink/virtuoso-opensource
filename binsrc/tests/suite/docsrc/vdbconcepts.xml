This document describes the SQL extensions, system tables and functions
related to the Virtuoso Universe virtual database.

<sect1 id="TRANSMODEL">
<title>Transaction Model</title>
<para>
One transaction on the Virtuoso Universe server may contain operations
on multiple remote data sources. As a general rule remote connections
are in manual commit mode and Virtuoso wither commits or rolls back the
transaction on each of the remote connections as the main transaction
terminates.
</para>
<para>
ODBC does not support two phase commit. Therefore a transaction that
succeeds on one remote party may fail on another.
</para>
<para>
A transaction involving local tables and tables on one remote data source
will always complete correctly since the remote is committed before the
local and the local is rolled back if the remote commit fails.
</para>
<para>
Note that even though the client to Virtuoso connection may be in
autocommit mode the continuing connections will typically not be
autocommitting.
</para>
<para>
A remote connection is in autocommit mode if the Virtuoso connection
is and the statement is passed through unmodified. In all other cases
remote connections are in manual commit mode.
</para>

<programlisting>B.DBA.vd_remote_data_source (

    in connstr varchar,
    in user varchar,
    in password varchar);</programlisting>
<para>
A remote data source is uniquely identified by its DSN, the dsn argument
to this function. The connstr argument is presently ignored. The user and
password are the login name and password to use when communicating with
the remote data source. All Virtuoso users dealing with the remote data
source will appear as this user to the remote data source. Virtuoso will
make as many connections as there are concurrent users of the data source.
Connections are cached by Virtuoso.
</para><para>
The default qualifier of the user of the remote data source is usually
not relevant.
</para><para>
Remote table names should be fully qualified.
</para>

<title>DB.DBA.vd_remote_table</title>
<programlisting>vd_remote_table (
    in dsn varchar,
    in local_name varchar,
    in remote_name varchar);</programlisting>
<para>
Declares an existing table as resident on a data source previously
declared with vd_remote_data_source.
</para><para>
This function declares the table local_name as table remote_name on
the dsn. The tables names should be full, names with qualifier and
owner. The names are case sensitive and must be in the exact case where
they appear in the local and remote schemas.
</para><para>
If remote_name is NULL, the effect of a possible previous vd_remote_table
is reversed. The table is thereafter treated as a local table, except
in procedures and statements compiled when the remote declaration was
in effect.
</para>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="TYPEMAPPING">
<title>Data Type Mappings</title>

<para>
If a statement is passed through to a remote data source, the types
returned by SQLDescribeCol are taken directly from the remote prepare
and converted to the closest Virtuoso supported type.
</para><para>
If a statement involves both local and remote objects all types are
taken from the Virtuoso copy of the data dictionary.
</para><para>
In executing remote selects Virtuoso binds output columns according
to the type and precision given by SQLDescribeCol after preparing the
remote statement.
</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="TIMESTAMP_AUTOINCREMENT">
<title>Timestamps &amp; Autoincrement</title>
<para>
A transaction timestamp is not the same across the transaction
if the transaction has branches in different databases.
</para><para>
The data type and precision of a time stamp will also vary between
different types of databases.
</para><para>
Hence timestamp columns coming from tables on different servers are not
comparable for equality.
</para><para>
In inserts and updates of remote tables timestamps are assigned by
the database where the table in question is physically located.
</para><para>
Indentity or autoincrement columns are likewise handled by the database holding the
remote table.
</para><para>
Note that MS SQL Server and Virtuoso describe a timestamp column as a binary column in ODBC
catalog and meta data calls.  Thus remote SQL Server or Virtuoso timestamps will not appear as timestamps at all.
</para><para>
In the case of a Virtuoso remote database the binary timestamp can be cast into a DATETIME data type
and it will appear as a meaningful datetime.

<para>This SQL statement defines a remote data source, copies the schema
information of a giventable to the local database and defines the table as a
remote table residing on the data source in question.
</para><para>
The table is a designation of the table&apos;s name on the remote data source dsn. It
may consist of an optional qualifier, optional owner and table names, separated
by dots.  This must identify exactly one table on the remote dsn. The optional
local_name is a on optionally qualified table name which will identify the table on
the local database. If qualifier or owner are omitted, these default to the current
qualifier &apos;dbname ()&apos; and the logged in user, as with CREATE TABLE. If the
local_name is not given it defaults to the &lt;current qualifier&gt;.&lt;dsn&gt;.&lt;table name on
dsn&gt;.  The &lt;dsn&gt; will be the dsn with all alphabetic characters in upper case and
all non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores. The &lt;table name on
dsn&gt; will be the exact name as it is on the remote dsn, case unmodified.
</para><para>
If a dsn is not previously defined with vd_remote_data_source or ATTACH
TABLE, the the USER and PASSWORD clauses have to be given.

<para>
These SQL functions correspond to the ODBC catalog calls of similar name.
These are used to access the data dictionary of remote data sources inside the
ATTACH TABLE process.
</para><para>
The dsn argument must refer to a dsn previously defined by
vd_remote_data_source or ATTACH TABLE.
</para><para>
For instance, the qualifier argument corresponds to the szTableQualifier and
cbTableQualifier arguments of an ODBC catalog function.  A SQL NULL value
corresponds to the C NULL value.  The arguments can contain % signs, which
are interpreted as in LIKE.
</para><para>
These functions return an array, with one element for each row of the result set.
Each row is represented as an array with one element for each column.

<sect2 id="MANSETRDS">
<title>Manually Setting up a Remote Data Source</title>
<para>
Defining a remote table involves declaring the table as a local table
and then defining the data source if not already defined and associating
the new table with the remote data source.
</para><para>
The data source on which a table resides is declared at the table
level. This has no connection to the table&apos;s qualifier.
</para><para>
Assume a remote ODBC data source named test containing a table xyz
declared as follows:
</para>

<example id="VDOCS-TRANS-01">
<title>Example:</title>
<programlisting>
   CREATE TABLE XYZ (
   A INTEGER,
	B INTEGER,
	C INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY (A));
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>
To defined this as a remote table on the data source Virtuoso, first
define the table locally, using the above CREATE TABLE statement above.
</para>
<para>
Then define the data source:
</para>
<programlisting>
DB..vd_remote_data_source (&apos;test&apos;, &apos;&apos;, &apos;sa&apos;,&apos;&apos;);
</programlisting>
<para>
And the table:
</para>
<programlisting>
DB..vd_remote_table (&apos;test&apos;, &apos;DB.DBA.XYZ&apos;, &apos;master.dbo.XYZ&apos;);
</programlisting>
<para>
This assumes that the remote data source has a login &apos;sa&apos; with an empty
password and no special connection string options. The table names in
vd_remote_table have to be fully qualified. We here assume that the
Virtuoso table was created by DBA in under the default qualifier DB and
the remote XYZ was created by dbo in master.
</para>
<para>
The vd_remote_table declaration does not affect statements or procedures
compiled prior to the declaration.
</para>
<para>
Additional indices of remote tables may optionally be defined. They do
not affect the operation of the SQL compiler. The remote data source
makes the choice of index based on the order by clause in the statement
passed through.
</para>
