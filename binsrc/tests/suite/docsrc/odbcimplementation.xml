<sect1 id="VScrlCURSORS"><title>Virtuoso Scrollable Cursor</title>
<para>Virtuoso implements server side scrollable cursors.
ODBC 2.0, ODBC 3.5 and JDBC 2.0 API&apos;s are supported.

	<para>This is the default, non-scrollable cursor.</para>
	</formalpara></listitem>
<listitem><formalpara><title>Static</title>
	<para>The cursor&apos;s evaluation is computed when the cursor statement is first executed.
	Positioned operations are possible but their effect will not show nor will changes be detected.</para>
	</formalpara></listitem>
<listitem><formalpara><title>Keyset</title>
	<para>When the cursor is opened a keyset is built.  Rows within the keyset
	can be fetched and modified by positioned operations. Changes will show when refreshing
	data and changes by other transactions will be detected for update and delete.
	Inserts by the same or different transaction will not appear.
	A keyset cursor may have a finite keyset size. When scrolling outside of
	the given keyset the keyset will shift to cover the new rows.</para>
	</formalpara></listitem>
<listitem><formalpara><title>Dynamic</title>
	<para>A dynamic cursor will reflect all changes by the same and different transactions.
	The dynamic cursor&apos;s evaluation is constructed as needed, hence it generally has
	less overhead than other types of cursors.</para>

<sect2 id="FwdOnlyCursors"><title>Forward Only Cursors</title>
<para>
A forward only cursor is substantially more efficient than a scrollable
cursor. It however dows not allow positioned operations (the WHERE CURRENT OF SQL phrase),
or SQLSetPos.  The SQLExtendedFetch function is supported but only the SQL_FETCH_NEXT
fetch type is then allowed.

</para>

<para>
The SQL_ROWSET_SIZE can be varied while a cursor is open.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="CursorsTransactions"><title>Cursors and Transactions</title>
<para>
All scrollable cursors survive committing or rolling back transactions.
All forward only cursors are implicitly closed by ending a transaction.
A scrollable cursor maintains its position over a transaction&apos;s end. Hence the
next fetch operation will resume from the correct place. If a cynamic cursor&apos;s cyrrent row / rowset is
deleted, the cursor will continue from the next greater / lesser row in the order of the cursor&apos;s
ordering columns.  This also applies to mixed mode (keyset with finite keyset size)
cursors scrolling outside of the keyset bounds.
</para>
<para>
The SQL_CONCURRENCY values of SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY and SQL_CONCUR_LOCK
cause Virtuoso to lock the rows in the keyset / rowset in shared or exclusive mode, respectively.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="OptimisticConcurrency"><title>Optimistic Concurrency Control</title>
<para>
A scrollable cursor may have a SQL_CONCURRENCY setting of SQL_CONCUR_VALUES. This
enables optimistic concurrency control.  This is a mechanism which will refect an
update or delete of a row if the row has been modified by a third party after the time the
application last read the row.
</para>
<para>
A &apos;updated meanwhile&apos; condition detected in this manner will prevent the operation and
return a SQL state of 01001 with SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO from SQLSetPos.
</para>
<para>
The updates and deletes made through SQLSetPos are still subject to being committed or rolled
back by normal transaction control.  The 01001 state does not prevent the current transaction
from committing.
</para>
<para>
The 01001 state is only detented if the update or delete is made by SQLSetPos and the row
at hand has been changed by any statement of any transaction. If the update of updated
operation is carried out by any other operation than SQLSetPos of the statement that last read
the value the condition cannot be  detected.
</para>
<para>
Note that the time between the last read and the SQLSetPos update can be long
and can span multiple transactions.

<para>
SQLRowCount is set after the initial SQLExecute. This is the actual row count or the keyset size
for a mixed mode cursor.  A dynamic cursor does not know this since it builds the evaluation as
needed.
</para>
<para>
All cursors support bookmarks.
</para>
<para>
The SQL_ROW_NUMBER is the ordinal number of the current row in the
cursor&apos;s evaluation.  A dynamic cursor can not know this, as the scrolling may
start from end and rows may appear on either side of the current row while the cursor is open.
</para>
<para>
&apos;reflect&apos; means that the new values or added / deleted rows
appear when re-scrolling over the rows. A deletion is reflected by
omitting the row.
</para>
<para>
&apos;motice&apos; means that the row is flagged by SQL_UPDATE, SQL_DELETED
or SQL_ADDED in the SQLExtendedFetch status array when the cursor re-scrolls over the
rows in question.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="CursorsVDB"><title>Cursors and Virtual Database</title>
<para>
The cursor subsystem modifies the cursor&apos;s defining select statement to
make various backward and forward read statements, update and delete statements etc.
These transformations can be seen through the explain function.
</para>
<para>
Since cursors are implemented by generating SQL statements these work transparently
against remote database, independently of their possible native cursor support.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="CursorSpecialCases"><title>Cursor Special Cases</title>
<para>
SQL SELECT statements fall in two categories: Simple, which consist of
one or more tables, an arbitrary WHERE clause abd an optional ORDER BY, and Comples, which includes
all other SELECT&apos;s, e.g. ones with GROUP BY, derived tables, full outer joins, UNION&apos;s etc.
</para>
<para>
A simple stetement can easily be modified to read backwards or forwards from a given point. Also,
each result row of a simple statement has a physical cunterpart, or many physical counterparts
for a join.  Having a physical counterpart makes it possible to define the meaning of a positioned
update or delete.  A GROUP BY is a counter-example.
</para>
<para>
All complex SQL statements occurring as cursors are processed as static
cursors regardless of the declared cursor type.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="CursorPerf"><title>Cursors and Performance</title>
<para>
If a cursor&apos;s ordering coeesponds to an ordering in an index, dynamic cursors will generally perform
best.  This is understandable since since the engine can quickly locate
the current row based on an index and then just read backward or forward on that index.
On the other hand, if the resilt set is very sparsely spread over the table or if
there is no ordering index dynamic cursors will have a substantial penalty.
</para>
<para>
If used as a forward only cursor in a single transaction, a dynamic cursor is only some
30% slower than a forward only cursor.
</para>
<para>
A static or keyset cursor has a relatively long execute time since the initial execute
will make the entire keyset. The initial execute of a dynamic cursor is instantaneous
since the fetch operations will do the work as needed.
</para>
<para>
With most off the shelf applications, e.g. Microsoft ADO, static and keyset cursors
are preferrable because the applications may rely on row counts and row numbers which
are not known for dynamic cursors.
</para>
<para>
Positioned operations are not affected by cursor type.
</para>

<sect1 id="CONN_STMT_OPTIONS"><title>Effect of Connection and Statement Options</title>
<sect2 id="ConnOpt"><title>Connection Options</title>
<sect3 id="SQL_AUTOCOMMIT"><title>SQL_AUTOCOMMIT</title>
<para>
The autocommit option is set at the connection level and affects
every statement executed after it being set.  Setting the option
does not communicate itself with the server and is therefore fast.
</para>
<para>
Autocommit is on by default. Autocommitting SELECT statements are executed
with read committed isolation. This is appropriate since any update
based on the autocommitting read would be in a different transaction and hence
would block to wait for access to the selected row.  Also re-evaluating
a select in autocommit mode would read the data in a different transaction.
Hence there is no point in repeatable read isolation for autocommitting
cursors.  Cursors inside procedures have the normal repeatable read isolation
regardless of whether the procedure was called in autocommit mode.
</para>
<para>
When an autocommitting statement starts it executed in the transaction
that&apos;s the connection&apos;s current transaction when it is received. Before
starting the autocommitting statement sets the connection&apos;s current
transaction to a new one. In this manner a client can issue multiple
asynchronous autocommitting statements at the same time and the statements
will execute concurrently, each in its own transaction.
</para>
<para>
If array parameters are used in a statement on an autocommitting
connection each parameter row will be processed in its own transaction
in sequential order.  Multiple  Asynchronous statements must be used to
execute one client&apos;s statements in parallel.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="SQL_TXN_ISO"><title>SQL_TXN_ISOLATION</title>
<para>
This option allows all the values defined in ODNC,
</para>
<para>
The isolation of an operation is the property of the operation rather than
of the transaction within which it takes place. Once an operation
has started, e.g. a cursor has been opened, its isolation cannot be changed.
</para>
<para>
The value of this option will affect any subsequently executed statement.
Note that setting this option to different values during a transaction will work,
thus a transaction can have cursors with different isolations although that
is presumably not the intention of the ODBC specification.
</para>
<para>
See the transaction model for a definition of the different isolation lovels.
</para>
<para>
A statement in autocommit mode executes
in the same transaction as the previous statement. The transaction is
committed when the statement successfully completes.  The next statement in
the connection will execute in the fresh transaction that was associated to
the connection at the start of the previous autocommitting statement.
</para>
<para>
As a consequence of this multiple concurrent autocommitting transactions may execute
on the same connection at the same time.
</para>
<para>
Statements executed with array parameters execute each set of
parameters as a separate transaction if the connection is in autocommit
mode.

This has the effect of reversing any SQL_CONCUR_LOCK concurrency to SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY.

<sect2 id="SQLSetStmtOpion"><title>SQLSetStmtOption Statement Options</title>
<para>
Virtuoso supports all ODBC 2.x and ODBC 3.x statement options.
This only mentions options where there are implementation specific
comments to be made.
</para>

<sect3 id="SQLConcurrency"><title>SQL_CONCURRENCY</title>
<para>
The supported values are SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY, SQL_CONCUR_LOCK and SQL_CONCUR_VALUES, the
last only for scrollable cursors.  A select statement with SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY will make
shared locks when locking for repeatable read or serializable transactions.  The
SQL_CONCUR_LOCK for a select statement will cause it to make exclusive locks, as
if it had the FOR UPDATE clause specified.
</para>
<para>
See the section on scrollable cursors for the effect of SQL_CONCUR_VALUES. For
all statements except scrollable cursors this value reverts to SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY.
</para>
<para>
Any searched update or delete statements will make exclusive locks in all cases.

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="SQLPrefetchSize"><title>SQL_PREFETCH_SIZE</title>
<para>
This is an extension option that controls how many rows of a forward only cursor are
prefetched by the execute and fetch calls.  A high value is advantageous for
long consecutive reads since it cuts down on the number of client server messages
exchanged.  On the other hand a large value can result in unnecessary data transfer
and locking if only the first few rows of a cursor are fetched.  A value of -1 will
cause the entire rowset to be fetched at the execute, so that no matter the select size, only
one message is exchanged.  The default is 20 but can also be set in the virtuoso.ini file.
</para>
<para>
A select with array parameters will always work as with a SQL_PREFETCH_SIZE of -1, meaning that
all the result sets are computed and sent to the client by the SQLExecute
call that opens the cursor.

DO NOT USE SQLExecDirect. If a statement is executed more than once it
is much faster to prepare the statement with SQLPrepare and then use
SQLExecute repeatedly. The system only compiles the statement once,
therefore there is no parsing overhead for repeatedly compiling the
same text but passing the statement&apos;s description back to the client
TAKES LONG. This is to be fixed.

Array parameters for insert, update or single row selects are about
