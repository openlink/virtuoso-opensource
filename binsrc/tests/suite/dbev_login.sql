--sample DBEV_LOGIN hook
-- called just before a client is authenticated to the virtuoso server
--
-- paramters:
--   user_name       :
--      IN : the user name from the login data
--     OUT : the user name used by Virtuoso for this connection
--   digest          : the password digest calculated by the client (or the password itslef for older clients)
--   session_random  : the random key used to calculate the digest
--
-- return value: the continuation code
--         -1 - continue with normal verification
--          0 - reject the login
--          1 - allow the login (the user returned should be a valid Virtuoso local user name
