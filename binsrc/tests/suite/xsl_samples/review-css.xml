    <p><summary>The small town of <city>Palabro</city> seems like
    an unlikely place for a high-class culinary establishment, but
    the <self>Red Apple Inn's</self> Chef <person>Alex
    Choperoni</person> is earning a national reputation for innovative
    dishes.</summary>  And rightly so, if this reviewer's recent
    culinary experience is any example.</p>
  
    <p>Within striking distance from the ski slopes at <city>Jackson
    Hole</city>, the <self>Red Apple Inn</self> is a completely
    restored Victorian hotel, and offers a warm and elegant atmosphere and
    gracious service.  The upscale clientele includes regular
    appearances by movie stars <person>Drew Barrymore</person> and
    <person>Matthew Broderick</person>.  Reservations are a must, and
    during the ski season it is not uncommon for the dining room to
    be booked solid six weeks in advance.</p>
    
    <p>It is hard to go wrong with a menu this packed with interesting
    choices.  The crab cakes are especially fine with a thin crisp
    crust that opens with a gentle prod of a fork to reveal a light,
    moist, almost mousse-like interior with a rich nutty flavor.</p>
  
    <p>The <self>Red Apple Inn</self> boasts one of the finest wine
    cellars in the region.  None of the dishes we sampled were less than
    outstanding. Here are a few of the selections from the daily menu.</p>
