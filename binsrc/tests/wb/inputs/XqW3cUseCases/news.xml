           In surprising developments today, Foobar Corporation announced that
         it is suing Gorilla Corporation for patent infringement. The patents
         that were mentioned as part of the lawsuit are considered to be the
         basis of Foobar Corporation's <quote>Wireless Foo</quote> line of
            products.
      </par>
      <par>
           The tension between Foobar and Gorilla Corporations has been increasing
         ever since the Gorilla Corporation acquired more than 40 engineers who
         have left Foobar Corporation, TheAppCompany Inc. and
         YouNameItWeIntegrateIt.com over the past 3 months. The engineers who
         have left the Foobar corporation and its partners were rumored to be
         working on the next generation of server products and applications
         which will directly compete with Foobar's Foo 20.9 servers. Most of the
         engineers have relocated to Hawaii where the Gorilla Corporation's
         server development is located.
