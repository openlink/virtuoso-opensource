<!--! \brief Validation of text area input with separate error summaries place
The form contains two v:textarea controls with v:validator elements inside.
When the OK button is pressed data are posted back to the same URI
so the page is instantiated again.
If any validator found a violation the message is shown to the user
in the place specified by v:error-summary element depending of a match attribute.
