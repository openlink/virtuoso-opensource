    <para>
	In general query's context node may either be a single resource or a collection.
    </para>
    <para>
	This page asks which option to be used for query context (the values/selection will be asked on the next screen depending of type selected here):
    </para>
    <simplelist>
      <member>DAV Resource - local WebDAV resource</member>
      <member>DAV Collection - local WebDAV collection containing a resources</member>
      <member>Database Table - document kept in a table</member>
      <member>External URL - external document or external WebDAV collection</member>
      <member>No context - an empty document will be used for context node</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>	
	The DAV browser allows selecting a resource or collection from the local DAV
	space. If a collection is selected, all XML resources therein are
	concatenated into a forest as by the collection function.  This is placed
	under an element node called "root" and is used as the context of the query.
    </para>

    <para>
	if an external resource is desired as the context node, the URL may be
	entered.  This will be retrieved either with the collection or the doc
	function, as indicated by the check-box.
    </para>

    <para>
	Because many resources are not well formed, the check-box Skip Malformed
	allows skipping resources which are not parseable as XML from the  context
	collection.  The Parse as HTML checkbox will parse HTML, correcting tag
	nesting.
    </para>
