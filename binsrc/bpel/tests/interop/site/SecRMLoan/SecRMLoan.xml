    <title>Example</title>
    <para>This example is a combination of Secure and Reliable Loan Flow examples.</para>
    <para>
        The calls to the asynchronous services must be done via WS-RM protocol.
    </para>
    <para>
	The calls to partners must be encrypted and signed using the rules:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
	<listitem>The caller must supply a signed and encrypted SOAP message.</listitem>
	<listitem>The process must reply from a separate HTTP connection to the endpoint designated by the caller's ReplyTo WSA header.</listitem>
        <listitem>The process' reply must contain a signed and encrypted SOAP message.</listitem>
        <listitem>X.509 certificates must be used to sign the message.</listitem>
        <listitem>The session keys can be tripple-des or AES (128, 192 or 256 bit quality).</listitem>
        <listitem>A Session key must be encrypted with the partner's RSA public key.</listitem>
        <listitem>The test certificates from MS WSE 2.0 toolkit can be used.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>To build the example follow the steps bellow:</para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>This example needs BPEL4WS VAD package to be installed on the server, before trying it. To learn more about VAD please visit http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/VAD.html.</listitem>
      <listitem>This example depends from the SecLoan and the RMLoan example. Make sure there are initial loads for these examples.</listitem>
      <listitem>The example script creates services for Credit Rating, United Loan and Star Loan.</listitem>
      <listitem>The WSDL descriptions for these services are available via CreditRating.vsp, UnitedLoan.vsp and StarLoan.vsp.</listitem>
      <listitem>On the initial load the BPEL Secure and Reliable Loan Flow process will be deployed.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>To run the example follow the steps bellow:</para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>Login into the BPEL UI via http://host:port/BPELGUI.</listitem>
      <listitem>To enable debugging for the process with name 'SecRMLoanFlow' check the Debug checkbox in the listing.
        This will cause all instances of the process to run in single-step mode,
        pausing at each send or receive of a message. The debug console allows
        interacting with instances in this mode.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>To test the process click "Test" in the listing. This goes to a page allowing you to enter a start message for creating a new instance of this process.</listitem>
