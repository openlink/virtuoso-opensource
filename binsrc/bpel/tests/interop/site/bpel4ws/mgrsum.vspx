                    Enterprises can now deploy business-critical transactions over
                    the Internet using the WS-Reliable Messaging (WS-RM) specification.
                    WS-RM support means that guaranteed (at-most-once, at-least-once,
                    and exactly once) messaging is now possible over HTTP. Virtuoso
                    BPEL implementation can also make use of Virtuoso full array of
                    web service protocols including WS-Security.

                    Virtuoso's extensive virtual database, XML and web services
                    features provide for intelligent transformation for XML and
                    non-XML applications and data. Virtuoso allows integration
                    of databases into Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), by
                    automating the creation of Web services from multiple tables
                    in any ODBC, JDBC or ADO. Net-compliant database. BPEL processes
                    can directly invoke locally hosted Java or .Net logic and access
                    SQL data from resident in local and remote tables. This enables
                    the rapid integration of that data with other services.
