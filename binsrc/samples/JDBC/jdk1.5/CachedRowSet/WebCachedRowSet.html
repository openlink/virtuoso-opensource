<h1>OpenLink JDBC 3.0 Cached RowSet Demonstration</h1>
<hr>
<p> This is a demonstration of an applet using OpenLink Software's
JDBC(tm) 3.0 Driver with the JDBC 3.0 specification. </p>

<h2>Starting</h2> <p>When the Web browser has finished loading the Java
applet, a window containing the JDBC applet will appear:</p>

<p><img src="WebCachedRowSet1.gif"></p>

<h2>Running a Query</h2>
<p>When it is running, click on the "Execute" button, it will execute
a SQL query against the default connection URL and populate this
CachedRowSet object with data. The current contents of the rowset are
discarded. If there are outstanding updates, they are also ignored. It
will closes any database connections that it creates. If successful, you
should see the first row of the resultset filling the applet window:</p>

<p><img src="WebCachedRowSet2.gif"></p>

<p>The "Accept" button will propagate all row update, insert, and delete
changes to a data source. When successful, it replaces the original
value of the rowset with the current value.</p>

<p>Click on the "Next" button to retrieve the next row, "Previous" to
go back a row, "First" to move directly to the first row, and "Last"
to move to the last row. </p>

<p>Clicking "Delete" will delete the current row from this rowset. It
will mark the current row as deleted, but it does not delete the row
from the underlying data source. The button "Accept" must be clicked
to delete the row in the data source.</p>

<p>Clicking on "Refresh" will set the current row with its original
value and marks the row as not updated, thus undoing any changes made
to the row since the last call to the "Update" or "Delete".  </p>

<p>Clicking on "Insert" will insert the contents of the insert row
into this rowset following the current row. It will mark the current
row as inserted, but it does not insert the row to the underlying data
source. The button "Accept" must be clicked to insert the row to the
data source.</p>

<p>Clicking on "Update" will mark the current row of this rowset as
updated but it does not update the row to the underlying data source. The
button "Accept" must be clicked to update the row to the data source.
To move to a particular position in the resultset, enter that position
into the edit box and click the "Absolute" button.</p>

<p>The "Relative" button will move the cursor position forwards or
backwards by the number of rows specified in the edit box. To move
backwards, enter a negative number.</p>

<p>The "CancelDelete" button will cancel deletion of the current row
and the current row is no longer marked for deletion.</p>

<p>The "CancelInsert" button will  cancel insertion of the current
row and the current row is immediately removed from the rowset. This
operation cannot be undone.</p>

<p>The "CancelUpdate" button may be clicked before clicking on "Update"
to rollback the updates made to a row. If no updates have been made or
"Update" has already been clicked, then this button has no effect.</p>

<p>The "SetOriginal" button will marks all rows in this rowset as being
original rows. Any updates made to the rows become the original values
for the rowset.  It cannot be reversed. </p>

<p>The "SetOriginalRow" button will  marks the current row in this
rowset as being an original row. The row is no longer marked as inserted,
deleted, or updated, and its values become the original values. It cannot
be reversed.</p>

<p>The "RestoreOriginal" button will restore the rowset to its original
state (the original value of the rowset becomes the current value). All
updates, inserts, and deletes made to the original state are lost. The
cursor is positioned before the first row.</p>

<h2>Changing the connection URL</h2>
<p>To change the connection URL, select "File|Set Connection URL.." from
the menu. A dialog box will appear enabling you to change the connection
URL, as well as the driver to use:</p>

<p>Please note that due to the applet security restrictions, it is only
possible to connect to the same server host as the Web server.</p>
