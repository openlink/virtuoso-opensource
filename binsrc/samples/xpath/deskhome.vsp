<H2>OpenLink Software XPath Demo</H2>
<H3>What it is and how it works</H3>

<P> XML Path Language (XPath) is a syntax for defining parts of an XML document, it also 
provides basic facilities for manipulation of strings, numbers and booleans.</P>

<P>The standard XPATH 1.0 is developmented, and the functionality
is documented, so we have added a first version of XPATH support into
our OpenLink Virtuoso Server. Links to the standard are on the left.</P>

<P>In this demo, the XML documents and associated DTDs are stored
within the Virtuoso server's database.  This server provides documents
over URLs via the Distributed Authoring and Versioning standard <a
href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html" target="_blank">WebDAV</a> (RFC 2518).</P>

<H3>Is there any technical support for this demo?</H3>

<P>Unlike other products of OpenLink Software, this demo is not
supported by our 24x7 help service.  Feel free to contact the authors
of this demo directly: <A
href="/ym/Compose?To=xquery@openlinksw.com">xquery@openlinksw.com</A>.  All
feedback is appreciated.</P>

<P>This demo has no safety limitations on time and memory consumption,
so it is easy to hang the demo computer by simultaneous asking for
dozen of terabyte-long results.  If you are unable to view the query
page, please retry a bit later.</P>
