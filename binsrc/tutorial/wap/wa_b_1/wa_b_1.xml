<title>Running the Demo on a WAP emulator</title>

<para>To simulate viewing the output on a wireless device. Run the
<ulink url="wap/wa_b_1/RunHtml2wml.vsp">RunHtml2wml.html</ulink> file.
Then choose a web-based emulator from one below:</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Wap.com -
  This is the most accurate Java and web based emulator, almost to the point
  of the definitive WAP SDK emulators from Openwave. However, its performance
  is not always optimal.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>Wapsilon.com -
  This is a reasonably accurate emulator, but the user interface handling is
  not quite the same as a real WAP phone.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>Wapmore.com -
  This is a PDA style emulator. Although its interface is a bit quirky, the
  performance is reasonable.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>Gelon.net -
  This is probably the fastest web-based WAP emulator; however, it sometimes
  exhibits problems displaying WML forms.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>Download WAP SDK -
  Our recommended option, this standard WAP SDK for emulators from
  <ulink url="http://www.openwave.com">Openwave.com</ulink>
  (formerly Phone.com).
