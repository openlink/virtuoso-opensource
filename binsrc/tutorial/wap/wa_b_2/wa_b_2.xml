<title>Preliminaries</title>
<para>This application demonstrates the power of Virtuoso XSL-T by
transforming an XML file in real time into a wireless phone emulator,
using a simple XSL stylesheet. Although fuller-featured WAP emulators exist,
this demo serves to illustrate what can be achieved with a few lines of VSP
code and accompanying stylesheet. However, a more comprehensive and
fuller-featured WAP emulator built around the same concepts may be
available soon.</para>
