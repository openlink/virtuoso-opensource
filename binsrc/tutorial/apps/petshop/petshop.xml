<title>Overview</title>
<para>
The PetShop application developed by Microsoft using ASP .Net and C# used in this tutorial is another demonstration of Virtuoso's ability to host ASP .Net projects.   This ASP .Net data driven shopping cart application for browsing and adopting Pets utilizes Virtuoso's 3rd Party hosting feature as well as the Virtuoso database as the data store. 
</para>
<para>
This demonstration is completely configurable and can be modified easily to change the data store to Microsoft SQL Server.

<title>Installation and Configuration</title>
<para>
This demonstration is based on the Virtuoso Universal Server running in a Windows operating system environment and includes configuration steps to run the PetShop application.   If you have installed the demonstration database and have an environment already running the Virtuoso demo instance, the SQL scripts and configuration files are already loaded and the virtual directory has been created as part of the installation.
</para>
<para>
If you are not running in this environment perform the following steps to demonstrate the PetShop Application
</para>
 
<orderedlist>
<listitem>In the folder vsp/Petshop under the Virtuoso Universal Server installation directory unpack and extract the OLEDB the .ZIP archive.</listitem>

<listitem>Register the PetShop.Components.dll as COM object using regsvcs utility, which is required to start the application.</listitem>

<listitem>Create the PetShop database schemas (MSPetShop and MSPetShopOrders), including tables and stored procedures and populate the databases using the following supplied SQL scripts located in the PetShop\DatabaseScripts\SQL subdirectory.  These scripts can be loaded using the OpenLink Virtuoso Interactive SQL Interface (ISQL) tool available from the OpenLink Virtuoso start menu using the DBA account.
