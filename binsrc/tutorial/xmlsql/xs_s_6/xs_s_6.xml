  <listitem>This example allows a selection from a document formed by
   <ulink url="../xs_s_1/xs_s_1.vsp">XS-S-1</ulink>, and applies a user-written XPATH expression to it.</listitem>
   <listitem><para>The page has selectable sample expressions including:</para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
    <listitem>Count of all titles</listitem>
    <listitem>Sum of the length of sect2 titles</listitem>
    <listitem>All first paragraphs of sect2's.</listitem>
   </itemizedlist></listitem>
  <listitem>The example uses xpath_eval, and iterates on the results if an array is produced.</listitem>
  <listitem>A single element of the XS-S-1 data is picked as the context node.</listitem>
  <listitem>A special button applies the operation on all rows with xpath_contains, showing the result set
   with doc name and result.</listitem>
  <listitem>This shows how one row can make multiple results with xpath_contains,
   but will return an array with xpath_eval.</listitem>
