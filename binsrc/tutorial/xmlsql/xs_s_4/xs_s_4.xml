  <listitem>The example shows entity references using data from <ulink url="../xs_s_1/xs_s_1.vsp">XS-S-1</ulink>.</listitem>
  <listitem>The VSP page has a button for retrieving title elements from a selected document, where the title
   element contains a substring.</listitem>
  <listitem>The example uses the 'xpath contains' predicate.</listitem>
  <listitem>The VSP page has a second button with the same function using text-contains.</listitem>
  <listitem>This illustrates that xcontains + text-contains does not go through links, but that xpath_contains +
contains does.</listitem>
  <listitem>The example has a viewer for the source of each page so that the entity references can be seen.</listitem>
  <listitem>The page has some of the rows of the text table as persistent XML and others as text.</listitem>
  <listitem>The columns are declared as ANY in SQL. This illustrates the late binding dependent on representation.</listitem>
