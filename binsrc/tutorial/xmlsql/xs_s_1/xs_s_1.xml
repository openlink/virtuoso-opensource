  <listitem>Virtuoso provides a compact and efficient free text indexing capability
   for text and XML data.  A free text index can be created on any character
   column, including wide and long data.</listitem>
  <listitem><para>If the column being indexed is XML data, this can be declared and enforced
   by the text index.  XML data will be indexed specially to support efficient
   XPATH predicate evaluation with the xcontains predicate.</para>

<listitem><para>The XML keyword specifies that the data is to be indexed as XML, hence
element names and attributes will be processed separately for use with the
