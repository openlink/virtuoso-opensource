<title>SOAP and WSDL registration example</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>This example makes a business record, and will define a service for it.</listitem>
  <listitem>The services can be provided by an organization (business).
  Without a defined provider service, it cannot be registered separately.</listitem>
  <listitem>Because there is no tModel for the service, one is provided
  for SOAP classification (tm.xml).</listitem>
  <listitem>Next step is to create a business description.(be.xml)</listitem>
  <listitem>Then create a service description (bs.xml).</listitem>
  <listitem>Then there is a binding (bnd.xml) of the service and business.</listitem>
  <listitem><para>This binding has two templates:</para>
  <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
    <listitem>SOAP template for information via Web page</listitem>
    <listitem>WSDL template for WSDL description of that service</listitem>
  </itemizedlist></listitem>
  <listitem>The example shows step by step for each template.</listitem>
