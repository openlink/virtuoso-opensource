  <listitem>This example repeats the example <ulink url="../so_s_7/so_s_7.vsp?f=1">SO-S-7</ulink>, but all VSPs for the SOAP client are hosted in the WebDAV repository.</listitem>
  <listitem>The SOAP &amp; WSDL service are achieved by defining the /SOAP_SO_S_9 URL to have same functionality as using soap_server() and soap_wsdl() calls.</listitem>
  <listitem>'/SOAP_SO_S_9' represents the so_s_8_server.vsp and /SOAP_SO_S_9/services.wsdl represents the so_s_8_wsdl.vsp</listitem>
  <listitem>Important: make sure that EnabledDavVSP is set to 1 in the INI file, to allow VSP execution in WebDAV.</listitem>
  <listitem>The example script loads all pages into the WebDAV, and sets their execution flags.</listitem>
