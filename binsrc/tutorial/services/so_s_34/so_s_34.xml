    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Microsoft Office 2003 provides a new tool called "The Research Library", which
    is available from the task pane in all of the Microsoft Office Suite including
    Microsoft Office Excel 2003, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft Office
    Word 2003, and Microsoft Office Outlook 2003.</para>

<para>By default, the Research Library allows to search for terms using several
    built-in resources. The Research Library is also extensible: users can add their
    own research service by creating a Web service that follows schemas defined for
    Microsoft research services.</para> 

<title>Prerequisites</title>

<para>The following prerequisites are needed to ensure that you can experience this
    demonstration.</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Virtuoso 3.5 or above</listitem>
    <listitem>Microsoft Office 2003 or higher</listitem> 
</itemizedlist>

<title>Tutorial Example</title>

<para>The following demonstration creates a service which exposes two methods:
    "Registration" and "Query". </para>

<para>The first method allows Microsoft Office to discover the Query service; also it
    could be extended to log the registration info for specific application
    purposes. The "Query" service is used to make a Free-text search within WebDAV
    repository by a given set of keywords entered by user in task panel. 
    The demo script also creates a virtual directory which forces 
    "Document/Literal" encoding of SOAP messages, which  is another way to expose
    Virtuoso PL stored procedures without having special SOAP user-defined data-types. </para>

<para>Please follow the steps below to maximize the value of this tutorial: </para>

<para>Step 1: Run the following sql script to set up so_s_34.sql.  </para>

<para>Step 2: After executing the initial setup above, add the service using a
    "Research" task pane by selecting "Research Options" and then "Add Services".  
    Note: To access this Research Task pane, select Research from the Tools menu, or
    by pressing Ctrl+F1 and choosing Research from the Other Task Panes drop-down list.</para>

<para>Step 3:  In the presented text entry for the Address , type the URL to the demo
    service http://host:port/VRes/ and press "Add", then "Continue" and finally
    "Install" (in that step "Virtuoso FTi Search (PL)" should be displayed). 
    Once you have installed the demo service, you can query it with typing search
    keywords in "Search for" text entry and selecting the "Virtuoso FTi Search (PL)"
    from drop-down box. On success a list of top 10 public readable items from
    WebDAV matching the "AND" of keywords will be displayed.</para>
