<title>Technology Uses</title>
In the world of Web services, each of these three operations involves three complimentary yet distinct technologies:
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Publishing services uses the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) API</listitem>
  <listitem>Locating services uses a combination of UDDI and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</listitem>
  <listitem>Binding to services leverages WSDL and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>At the most basic level, the Binding operation is the most important of the three.</para>

<title>Example</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>The example will create a SOAP based interface and WSDL description for searching an existing Customer Order</listitem>
  <listitem>New orders can be added into the demo database.</listitem>
  <listitem>The first page renders the WSDL as an HTML form for selecting the SOAP method.</listitem>
  <listitem>The second page renders the WSDL again to make a form for input parameters. Note that on this 
      entry form needs to be entered valid _CustomerID (for example ALFKI) and _ProductID (for example is 1).
      Otherwise the servce will generate SOAP Fault message. Also _ShipVia needs to have a correct value 
      to be entered (for example 1,2 or 3).  
  </listitem>
  <listitem>Final page displays the result from the SOAP call.</listitem>
