    <para>There are several mapping services available today, but they only provide point
	to point services. </para>

    <para>
    Once such service is from Microsoft, which has a SOAP-based MapPoint service
    that allows location searching and distance calculations.   The following
    demonstration uses the Microsoft MapPoint services to resolve addresses and to
    calculate the distance between two points.   The demonstration will also
    calculate an optimized round-trip from a given start point to the destinations
    specified. </para>

<para>
    In order to run the demonstration a MapPoint username and password are needed. 
    Evaluation accounts from Microsoft are available
