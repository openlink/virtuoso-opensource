<title>Example overview</title>
<para>
This example demonstrates usage of the WSDL_IMPORT_UDT() function.
The result from calling of the WSDL_IMPORT_UDT() is the creation of a 
User Defined Type (UDT) which represents the SOAP service. Each method in the UDT
represents an operation available from this SOAP service (proxy UDT).</para>
<para>
After successful retrieval of the WSDL, and UDT creation, the function
returns UDT definition as string.</para>
<para>
    The example also defines one test endpoint where it exposes the 
    imported UDTs are own methods. Therefore it's easy to test using 
    VSMX file for the demo endpoint. 
</para>
<para>
    To cleanup the endpoint, use 'Clear cache' button. This would 
    unpublish the SOAP proxy UDTs from the demo test endpoint.
</para>
<para>
    To setup and run, the initial script must be loaded.
