  This example demonstrates the processing of a result set obtained from a PL
  procedure defined on a remote database.</listitem>
  <listitem>
  The example shows a remote execution of a PL procedure against Microsoft
  SqlServer and Oracle DBMS.</listitem>
  <listitem>
  The remote procedure is called via rexecute(). The result set is converted
  to an XML document by a local PL procedure that can then be called via SOAP.
  The demo VSP pages offers a form to accept DSN, login info and a search
  string. A soap_call() is executed with these parameters, and the result is 
  parsed with an XSL-T engine for HTML output.
