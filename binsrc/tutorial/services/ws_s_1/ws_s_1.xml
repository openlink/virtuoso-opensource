<title>Example</title>
<para>
In order to have the rest of examples of this section working, the following steps must be performed.
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
 <listitem>The MS WSDK toolkit must be installed on a W2K mashine. The .NET examples are tested with 1.0.0.0 version of Microsoft.WSDK.dll, so make sure that version of that assembly is the same.</listitem>
 <listitem>Make sure that WS Secure examples of MS WSDK are working before trying any of interoperabilty examples.</listitem>
 <listitem>From this page run setup script (set the initial state), this will define symmetric keys, there is also included a x.509 import, but it's only for demonstration. </listitem>
<listitem>To make your WSDK applications to work with Virtuoso you need to export from W2K box the certificate and import with registration page on this example.</listitem>
<listitem>The setup script also defines a SOAP secure directory (/SecureWebServices) which is used in the rest of the examples.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The SOAP directory options we are using to secure the messages are:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem> WSS-SEC - yes/no , this is to enable WS secure processing</listitem>
<listitem> WSS-KEY - name of procedure , which will return a key instance to encrypt the outbound messages</listitem>
<listitem> WSS-Template - string or null, content of signature template, in that examples we will not make signatures on outbound messages. How to make signatures is explained in the x.509 siging example.</listitem>
<listitem> WSS-Type - 1/0 to make signature or to encrypt only</listitem>
<listitem> WSS-Validate-Signature - 0/1/2 - do not validate, validate signature, validate if exists
 in our examples we will accept both of variants, so 2 is used.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
