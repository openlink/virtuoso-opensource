The Virtuoso server can act as XML for Analysis (XMLA) tabular data provider.
XML for Analysis is a SOAP based XML API, 
designed specifically for data access interaction between a 
client application and a data provider working over the Web. 
The client application can do discovery of data provider information 
and execute of SQL statements. The result sets from server to client can be 
Multidimensonal and Tabular, at current state only Tabular is supported.
To setup an virtual directory to act as XMLA data provider, it needs to be 
defined as SOAP one and Discover and Execute procedures needs to be granted to the 
user account for SOAP execution.</para>

 <listitem>The example shows how SOAP enabled virtual directory can be exposed for XMLA.</listitem>
 <listitem>The SQL statements for setting up the virtual directory are shown in the .sql file</listitem>
 <listitem>In addition to the virtual directory setup, there is a grant to the Northwind Customers table 
 to be able to invoke select on that table via Execute method.
