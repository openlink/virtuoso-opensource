  This example demonstrates how to implement Google Maps API using XML and Asynchronous RPC ("AJAX").</para>

  <title>Breakdown</title>
  <para>In the Initial state we will extend the Demo.demo.Customers 
  table with some new fields (Longitude and Latitude). Then we will use 
  Yahoo GeoCode API to find Longitude, Latitude values for the customers addresses 
  and store the values in the database. The data_xml.vsp page generates 
  XML from that table similar to the one described in 
  <ulink url="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/#Using_XML_and_Asynchronous_RPC">Google Maps API Documentation</ulink>. 
  We have extend it a little bit to have information for the Customer Name and Address.
  Click on the 'googlemaps.vsp' Run link to see the generated Google Map. You can click on the markers to 
  view additional information.
