<title>Example</title>
<para>
This section describes how to make secure web services call, using a symmetric key encryption.
The algorithm used for these examples is tripple-des.
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem>Both server and client have a shared secret, which is used to encryt and decrypt the SOAP message.</listitem>
<listitem>In practice the key is transfered by some secure way between client and server, as if it's captured the all traffic between server and client can be compromised.</listitem>
<listitem>Virtuoso keeps keys internally and can be instantiated with xenc_key_instance_create ().</listitem>
<listitem>In this example we are using a key 'WSDK Sample Symmetric Key', imported from WSDK.NET SymmetricEncryption example. This is to have the same key in all places: .NET server and client, Virtuoso server and client.</listitem>
<listitem>Another posibillity is to generate the key on Virtuoso side with xenc_key_3DES_rand_create() and export to the .NET client and server configuration. To export the 3DES key can be used xenc_key_serialize () function. </listitem>

<para>
To run .NET client against Virtuoso service you need:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem>This example works with MS WSDK; MS WSE 2.0 obsolete the data encryption directly a key data.</listitem>
<listitem>to change &lt;virtuoso:port&gt; to host and port where your virtuoso HTTP server is listening.</listitem>
<listitem>compile the example issuing nmake command in the tutorial/services/ws_s_2 directory.</listitem>
<listitem>if you going to compile the client on an other box, make sure that .config file is in the same directory where is .exe file.</listitem>
