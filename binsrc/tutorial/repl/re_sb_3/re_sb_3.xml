<para>In order to run this example you need two Virtuoso servers running
(publisher and subscriber). In the example scripts it is assumed that the first Virtuoso server
(publisher) is running at localhost:1111 and the second Virtuoso server
(subscriber) is running at localhost:1112. If you are running ODBC
versions of the servers there should be 2 ODBC DSN's records named
"localhost:1111" and "localhost:1112". Subscriber should have
"ServerName" configuration parameter set to "demoserver2".
