<title>Preliminaries</title>
<para>Every DAV collection on publisher can have a number of conflict resolvers
which are used for conflict resolution. Each conflict resolver has an
integer number (order) associated with it. Conflict resolvers are applied
in ascending order.</para>

<para>Conflict resolver is a Virtuoso/PL procedure which receives conflicting
DAV resource. DAV conflict resolver signatures are described in Virtuoso
documentation. Conflict resolver can modify the resource which is passed in
as 'inout' arguments. Conflict resolver should return an integer value which
will be used for conflict resolution. Possible return values and their meaning
are described in Virtuoso documentation.</para>

<para>There is a possibility to automatically generate some types of
conflict resolvers. Automatically generated conflict resolver classes are:
