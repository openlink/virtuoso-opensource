<title>Preliminaries</title>
<para>Because every table can have only one publisher conflicts can occur
only on publisher (when modifications from subscriber are applied).</para>

<para>Every table on publisher can have a number of conflict resolvers
which are used for conflict resolution. Each conflict resolver has a type
('I', 'U', or 'D') and an order. Conflict resolvers are applied
in ascending order.</para>

<para>Conflict resolver is a Virtuoso/PL procedure which receives conflicting
row (row from subscriber) and some other arguments. Conflict resolver
signatures are described in Virtuoso documentation.
Conflict resolver can modify the row which is passed in as 'inout' arguments.
Conflict resolver should return an integer value which will be used
for conflict resolution. Possible return values and their meaning
are described in Virtuoso documentation.</para>

<para>Conflict resolution occurs differently for each kind of DML operation.
Details can be found in Virtuoso documentation.</para>

<para>There is a possibility to automatically generate some types of
conflict resolvers. Automatically generated conflict resolver classes are:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>max - 
    <para>row with maximum value of specified column wins</para></listitem>
  <listitem>min -

  <listitem>ave - 
    <para>new value of specified column is calculated as:</para>

  <listitem>Click "Conflict Resolvers" for the desired published table ("Demo.demo.Orders").</listitem>

  <listitem>Enter conflict resolver name suffix (enter "max_OrderDate"),

  select conflict resolver class (select "max"),
  select a column (select "OrderDate"). You can optionally
  specify conflict resolver order (default is 100).</listitem>
  <listitem>Press "Add" button. A conflict resolver will be added. You
