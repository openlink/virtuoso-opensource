<title>Preliminaries</title>
<para>This sample shows how to replicate two heterogeneous DSNs (MySQL DSN and Microsoft SQL Server DSN for example) with all logic in Virtuoso.
    The replicated table has two columns. First is varchar Primary key, second integer representing user data.
</para>

<title> Sample includes: </title>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>Select DSN for demo. There must be two connected DSNs to start the sample.</listitem>
  <listitem>Create tables on the two DSNs.</listitem>
  <listitem>Attach tables from these DSNs.</listitem>
  <listitem>Show simple page with table content.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<title> How it works: </title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
    <listitem>The Primary key plus timestamp column from source is replicated locally.</listitem>
    <listitem>On initial state  all date from the first DSN  s copyed to the Second.</listitem>
    <listitem>The user table on the first DSN has one timestamp column more that the table on the second. This column is used to get new / changed rows on replication state.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
