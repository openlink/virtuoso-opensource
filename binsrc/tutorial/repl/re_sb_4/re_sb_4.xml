<title>Preliminaries</title>
<para>This tutorial demonstrates basic snapshot replication features.
In order to run this tutorial execute the following steps:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>Setup ODBC data source named "demoserver2".</listitem>
<listitem>Make sure that user "demo" with password "demo"
can connect to data source "demoserver2".</listitem>
<listitem>Make sure that there is no table named "Shippers"
in target data source.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
The data source can be Virtuoso data source as well as any other data
source type which is supported by Virtuoso bidirectional snapshot replication
(E.g. Oracle or MS SQL data source). This tutorial will
demonstrate Virtuoso heterogeneous snapshot replication capabilities.
