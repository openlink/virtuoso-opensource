<title>For XML SQL Clause Overview</title>

<para>This feature enables the execution SQL queries against the Virtuoso Server to return results as XML 
documents rather than as standard rowsets. To retrieve results directly, use the FOR XML clause of the 
SELECT statement and in the FOR XML clause, specify one of these XML modes:</para> 
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
   <listitem>RAW - transforms each row in the query result set into an XML element with the generic identifier row. </listitem> 
   <listitem>AUTO - returns query results as nested XML elements.</listitem> 
   <listitem>EXPLICIT - authors of query can control the structure of the XML document returned by the query. </listitem>
</itemizedlist> 
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id="XS-F-1b">
<title>Examples</title>

<para>This example shows a simple use of the For XML SQL 'Auto' statement for executing a query and returning 
the results in XML format.</para>
