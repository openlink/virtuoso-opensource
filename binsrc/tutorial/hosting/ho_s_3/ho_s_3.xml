    <refpurpose>Demonstrating the use of C# to create Virtuoso hosted Stored 
    Procedures and Triggers. In this demo the database events trigger SMS 
    messages that are relayed via C# based SOAP Client.</refpurpose>

    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The following tutorial demonstrates how a C# based Managed SOAP 
    Client is used to create SMS based database notification services inside 
    Virtuoso. This demo executes a database trigger every time a new Supplier 
    record is added, updated or deleted. In this example a C# class acts as a
    SOAP client to a 3rd party XML Web Service that provides the SMS (Short Message 
    Services) delivery to mobile phones. Note, this demo will work with any phone 
    that is capable of receiving SMS (TEXT) messages.</para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>Click on the "Set Initial State" link which registers the "redcoalsmssvc" service with Virtuoso. Click on the "ho_s_3.sql" link to see the code behind this step</listitem>

  <para>Demo Breakdown</para>
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>"ho_s_3.sql" performs the following steps
  <orderedlist>
     <listitem>Registers the "redcoalsmssvc" class with Virtuoso. Click on the "redcoalsms.cs" and "redcoalsmsref.cs" links to see the C# source code. Note that the class "redcoalsmssvc" is part of an assembly that has the namespace "redcoalsms"</listitem>
     <listitem>Creates the "Suppliers" table </listitem>
     <listitem>Creates a stored procedure "redcoal_send_sms" which demonstrates the syntax for creating an instance variable which includes the assembly namespace in the type reference. Specifically, note the use of an underscore instead of a dot when making this assignment </listitem>
     <listitem>Creates a Trigger named "send_sms_to_mgr_new_supp" that sends an SMS message each time a new "Supplier" table record is inserted</listitem>
     <listitem>Creates a Trigger named "send_sms_to_mgr_mod_supp" that sends an SMS message each time a "Supplier" record is updated</listitem>
     <listitem>Creates a Trigger named "send_sms_to_mgr_mod_supp" that sends an SMS message each time a supplier record is deleted</listitem>
  </orderedlist></listitem>
  <listitem>"setup_sms.vsp" sets up all of the base data and verifies that SMS service connectivity required by this demo is available.</listitem>
   <listitem>"handler.vsp" is the actual interface through which you add or delete supplier records which result in SMS notifications being sent to your mobile phone.</listitem>
