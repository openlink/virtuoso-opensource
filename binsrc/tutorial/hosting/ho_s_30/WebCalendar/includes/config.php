// Read-only mode: You can set this to true to create a read-only calendar.
// If you enable $single_user_login (below), no login will be required,
// making this a publicly viewable calendar.  In order to add events to
// a setup like this, you will need to setup another installation of this
// application that is not read-only.
// If $readonly is enabled in multi-user mode, only admin users will able
// to add/edit/delete events.
// NOTE: Approvals are not disabled in read-only.  You must also disable
// approvals if you don't want to use them.
// NOTE #2: Using $readonly has mostly been superceded by the new public
// access calendar (added in version 0.9.35).  The new system allows
// a public access calendar with no login or a regular calendar with
// a valid login.  This is configured in the admin web interface.

// multi-user).  In single-user mode, you will not be prompted for a login,
// nor will you be asked to select participants for events.
// NOTE: If you select single-user and then upgrade to multi-user later,
// you'll have to add in the login name you've set below to the cal_user
// table.  Set $single_user to either true or false.  If true, make sure
// $single_user_login is defined.
