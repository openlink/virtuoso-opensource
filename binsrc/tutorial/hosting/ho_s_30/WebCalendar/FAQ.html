<A NAME="version">How do I get the latest development version of WebCalendar?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The latest code snapshot is always available through CVS on
   SourceForge.  If you're not comfortable with CVS, then stick to
   public releases.  In order to get the files from CVS, use the
   following command to login to CVS for the first time:
   <P>

     <TT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.webcalendar.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webcalendar login</TT>
   <P>

   (If you get a connection refused error, make sure you set your
   CVS_RSH environment variable to ssh.)
   Then, to get the files for the first time, use the following command:
   <P>

     <TT>cvs -z8 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.webcalendar.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webcalendar co webcalendar</TT>
   <P>

   This should create a new webcalendar directory in the current directory.
   After you've done this, you can get the latest code with:
   <P>

     <TT>cvs update</TT>

   <P>
   You can find these instructions online at:

<A NAME="cvs">How do I get more info on CVS?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     You can start at the SourceForge CVS HOWTO:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="login">When I try to login, I get sent back to the login page with no error.</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Make sure that you built PHP with <TT>--enable-track-vars</TT> during the
   <TT>configure</TT> step.  Make sure your browser has cookies enabled.  Either
   of these can cause this problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="windows">Does WebCalendar work under Windows?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Yes, it will work unders MS Windows.
   <P>

   If you don't have PHP setup yet on your Windows machine, you
   may want to take a look at
   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/foxserv/">FoxServ</A>.
   This nifty tool installs
   a PHP server environment (PHP, MySQL, and Apache) on Windows
   for you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="php4">Does it work with PHP 4?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yep.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="php3">Does it work with PHP 3?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yep.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="apache">How do I install Apache with PHP and MySQL?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are many online guides to doing this.  Start with the PHP.net
pages first.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.obtaining.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.obtaining.php</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="quotes">Why do quotations not enter into the database properly?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The system is designed to work with PHP's magic quotes feature
   that automatically adds backslashes for you.  (This is configurable
   in <TT>php.ini</TT>.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="layers">What are layers?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Using layers allows you to overlay another user's calendar onto
   your calendar.  Each calendar of another user that you overlay
   onto your calendar is called a layer (for lack of a better word).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="reminders">Why do my reminders get sent later than I think they should be sent?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   If you setup a reminder to be sent 15 minutes before an event (like
   a meeting), you must run the send_reminders.php script frequently
   enough so that it will run after the reminder should be sent and
   before the actual event.  (Meaning it needs to be run more frequently
   than every 15 minutes.  Maybe every 5 minutes would work well in this
   situation.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="public">How do I setup a public calendar?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   There are two answers... depending on whether your are using WebCalendar's
   web-based authentication (the default) or HTTP-based authentication
   (configured in your web server).
   <P>

   <B>For web-based auth:</B>
   Simply go to the "System Settings" page (link is on the bottom of all
   pages if you login as a user that is an Administrator).  From there,
   change "Public Access" to "Yes", and you're done.  Logout by clicking
   on the "Login/Logout" link, and a "Public Access" link will appear
   on the login page.
   <P>

   <B>For HTTP-based auth:</B>
   This is more complicated and will depend on what web server you are using.
   Below are instructions for Apache.  Use the following in your
   <TT>.htaccess</TT> file in your WebCalendar directory.
   alias to the WebCalendar installation for public access and one for
   restricted access (requires login).  In Apache's conf directory, edit
   <TT>httpd.conf</TT> and add the following:

<PRE>
   AuthUserFile "users.txt"
   AuthName "WebCalendar"
   AuthType  "Basic"
   &lt;Limit GET&gt;
   Satisfy any
   &lt;/Limit&gt;
   &lt;Files login.php&gt;
   &lt;Limit GET&gt;
   require valid-user
   Satisfy all
   &lt;/Limit&gt;
   &lt;/Files&gt;</PRE>

   The file <TT>users.txt</TT> is managed by Apache's htpasswd
   program and is simply a listing of users and encrypted passwords.
   You should place this is in Apache's server root directory and NOT
   in the WebCalendar directory.  To create <TT>users.txt</TT>, you would do
   something like this:
   <P>
   	<TT>htpasswd -c users.txt myfirstuser</TT>
   <P>
   Where "myfirstuser" is the first username you want to add.  See
   the Apache installation instructions for more on using htpasswd.
   <P>

   Also, don't forget to go to the WebCalendar "System Settings" page
   and enable "Public Access".
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="translate">I'd like to translate WebCalendar into another language.  What do I do?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   It's a fairly simple process.  If you've ever translated a C-based app
   that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem.  The I18N
   support was based on GNU's <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">gettext</A>.  Here's what you need to do.
   <OL>
   <LI> look in the "translations" directory
   <LI> copy the <TT>English-US.txt</TT> file into what you'd like to call your
     language data file.  (e.g. <TT>cp English-US.txt French.txt</TT>)
   <LI> Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ":" into the
     new language.  Do <i>not</i> alter the text to the left of the ":".
   <LI> When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
     Run the <TT>check_translation.pl</TT> script on your new data file to make
     sure you have all the needed translations.
     (e.g. <TT>perl check_translation.pl French</TT>)
   <LI> Add the new language to both the $languages array and the
     $browser_languages arrays defined in <TT>includes/config.php</TT>.
   <LI> Test it out...
   <LI> Email a copy of the new .txt data file to <A HREF="mailto:cknudsen@radix.net" SUBJECT="WebCalendar Translation">cknudsen@radix.net</A>.
   </OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="translateupdate">I'd like to update a translation for WebCalendar.  What do I do?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Just open up the translation file in the <TT>translations</TT> directory
   with your favorite text editor (like vi, vim, emacs, pico, Notepad, etc.).
   In particular look for places where missing translations are indicated.
   All missing translations should be marked with a
   <NOBR>"<&lt;&lt; MISSING &gt;&gt;"</NOBR> note, and typically the English version
   of the translation will also be included on the following line.
   <P>
   When you're done making changes, move into the <TT>tools</TT> directory.
     Run the <TT>check_translation.pl</TT> script on your new data file to make
     sure you have all the needed translations.
     (e.g. <TT>perl check_translation.pl French</TT>)
   <P>Don't forget to contribute the updated translation back to the project!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="binhex">I get an error about binhex() being an unsupported function.  What</A>
   does that mean?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   The <TT>binhex()</TT> function was not in the early PHP 3.0.X releases.  You
   need to upgrade to a more recent PHP3 (or use PHP4).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="sessions">Why aren't you using PHP4 sessions or PHPLIB sessions?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   It would really be overkill for what the application needs.  It also
   simplifies installation by not requiring PHPLIB or PHP4.  A future
   version might switch to PHP4 if PHP4 is detected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="adodb">Why aren't you using ADODB for database access?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Again, this would be overkill for what we need.  ADODB is almost
   as big as WebCalendar itself, so I'm partial to my leaner php-dbi.php
   solution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="demo">Is there an online demo?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Yes, there is.  Use "demo" for login and "demo" for password at:
   <P>
   <A HREF="http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/">http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/</A>
   <P>
   Don't be surprised if it appears in a language other than English.
   Changing the language setting seems to be a favorite.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="bugs">Where do I report bugs? </A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   You can report bugs on SourceForge at:
   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=3870">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=3870</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME="help">Where do I get help?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Try the Forums on SourceForge:
   <P>
   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=3870">http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=3870</A>
   <P>
   Someone has even posted some links for problems setting up PHP and MySQL.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="license">What license is WebCalendar distributed under?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	WebCalender is distrubuted under the GPL.  (See <A HREF="GPL.html">GPL.html</A> file included
   with the distribution.)
