<HR><H3><A NAME="requirements">Requirements</A></H3>

You must have PHP and one of the following databases installed:
<UL>
<LI> MySQL
<LI> Oracle 8
<LI> PostgreSQL
<LI> Interbase
<LI> ODBC
</UL>
For the database you choose, you must have its drivers built into
PHP.  For example, to use MySQL, PHP must be compiled with MySQL
support (which is the default setting when installing PHP).
See the PHP pages (<A HREF="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</A>)
for more information on setting up PHP.
<P>

No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
application.  However, PHP shoud be compiled with <TT>--enable-track-vars</TT>
on some systems. 

<P>

Make sure that <TT>magic_quotes_gpc</TT> in <TT>php.ini</TT>
is turned on (otherwise, you
will get database errors when entering quotation marks in HTML forms).

<P>
You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling.  Additionally, this application can use
a form/cookie-based authentication or traditional HTTP authentication.
For traditional HTTP authentication, PHP must be built as an Apache
module.

<P>
If you are planning on using email reminders, you will need to build
PHP as a CGI in order to run the <TT>send_reminders.php</TT> script.  I would
strongly recommend building a module-based PHP for your web server
and then a second PHP build to create the CGI version.


<HR><H3><A NAME="fileunpacking">File Unpacking</A></H3>
Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)
<P>
By default, WebCalendar should create its own directory
when you unpack it.  The new directory name will typically
contain the version name (such as <TT>WebCalendar-0.9.35</TT>).
You can rename this directory after unpacking the files if you
prefer a directory name like <TT>calendar</TT> or <TT>webcalendar</TT>.
Keep in mind that unless you remap the directory (via your web server's
configuration settings), it will be part of
the URL for the calendar.


<HR><H3><A NAME="databasesetup">Database Setup</A></H3>
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	MySQL (from command line):<BR>
	<TT>mysqladmin create intranet</TT><BR>
	(This will create a database named "intranet".)
	<P>

	Oracle (from within sqlplus):<BR>
	<TT>CREATE TABLESPACE webcalendar
	DATAFILE 'webcalendar.dat' SIZE 10M
	AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE 40M;</TT>
	<P>

	PostgreSQL (from within psql):<BR>
	<TT>create database webcalendar;<BR>
		\c webcalendar<BR>
		\i tables-postgres.sql<BR>
		\q</TT>
	<P>

	Interbase (from within usql)<BR>
	<TT>CREATE DATABASE 'WEBCAL.gdb';</TT><BR>
	(This will create a database named "WEBCAL.gdb")
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

You will want to setup a new user that defaults to
this new tablesapce:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Oracle (from within sqlplus):<BR>
	<TT>CREATE USER webcalendar IDENTIFIED BY webcal01
		DEFAULT TABLESPACE webcalendar;<BR>
		GRANT dba TO webcalendar;</TT><BR>
	(Note: I use "webcal01" for a password rather than
	"web!calendar" because sqlplus barfs on the "!")
	<P>

	To do this in MySQL:<BR>
	<TT>mysql --user=root mysql<BR>
		mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO webcalendar@"%"
		IDENTIFIED BY 'webcal01' WITH GRANT OPTION;<BR>
		mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Create the calendar tables using the supplied <TT>tables.sql</TT> file:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	MySQL (from command line):<BR>
	<TT>mysql intranet < tables-mysql.sql</TT><BR>
	(where "intranet" is the name of your database)
<P>
Oracle (from command line):<BR>
<TT>sqlplus webcalendar/webcal01<BR>
	@tables-oracle;</TT>
<P>
PostgreSQL:<BR>
	(This was already done using the PostgreSQL commands
	above.)
<P>
Interbase (from within isql)<BR>
  <TT>connect /path/WEBCAL.gdb;<BR>
	  input path/table-ibase.sql;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This will create all the needed tables and setup one user account
with the login "admin" and password "admin", which you are encouraged
to use to create your own account.


<HR><H3><A NAME="applicationsetup">Application Setup</A></H3>
Next, you will need to customize the file <TT>includes/config.php</TT>
to tell WebCalendar which database you are using and what
the database login/password is.
Use your favorite text editor (vim, emacs, notepad, etc.)
to make these changes.

<P>
To configure your database access.  Set the values for:
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="top">$db_type</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">One of "mysql", "oracle", "postgresql",
"odbc", or "ibase"</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top">$db_host</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">The hostname that database is running on.
(Use localhost if it's the same machine as
the web server.) (This variable is not used with ODBC)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top">$db_login</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">The database login</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top">$db_password</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">The database password for the above login</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top">$db_database</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">The name of the database that the calendar
tables reside in.  ("intranet" in the example
above.)
For ODBC, this should be the DSN.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

You can configure the calendar to run in single-user mode or multi-user mode.
If this is your first time using the calendar, it's easier to try single-user.
You can always switch to multi-user later.  Leave <TT>$single_user</TT> set to
"N" (the default) for multi-user or set it to "Y" and set the
value of <TT>$single_user_login</TT> to a login name of your liking
to set the system to single-user mode.
(And be sure to set the value of <TT>$single_user_login</TT> to the login that you
would choose if you decide to switch to multi-user mode some day.)
<P>

Note: If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode,
make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the
<TT>$single_user_login</TT> variable to.  You will need to do this via the
database (mysql, sqlplus, etc...)  Look in the <TT>tables-mysql.sql</TT>
(or <TT>tables-oracle.sql</TT>, etc.) to see the example of adding in the
"admin" user.
<P>

If you are setting up a multi-user calendar, you will need to choose
how your users are authenticated.

You must change the settings of <TT>$use_http_auth</TT> and <TT>$user_inc</TT> within the <TT>config.php</TT> configuration file to setup which authentication method to use.

<P>

You currently have four choices:

<OL>
<LI> Web-based authentication (login/passwords verified in the WebCalendar database):<BR>
	<TT>$use_http_auth = false;</TT><BR>
	<TT>$user_inc = "user.php";</TT>
<LI> HTTP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by the web server):<BR>
	<TT>$use_http_auth = true;</TT><BR>
	<TT>$user_inc = "user.php";</TT><BR>
	... and don't forget to setup your web server to handle user
	authentication.  (Note: In order to use HTTP-based authentication,
	PHP must be setup as a module for your server rather than a CGI.)
<LI> NIS-based authentication (login/passwords verified by NIS):<BR>
	<TT>$use_http_auth = false;</TT><BR>
	<TT>$user_inc = "user-nis.php";</TT><BR>
	Additional configuration settings will need to be set
	in <TT>includes/config/user-nis.php</TT>.
<LI> LDAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by LDAP server):<BR>
	<TT>$use_http_auth = false;</TT><BR>
	<TT>$user_inc = "user-ldap.php";</TT><BR>
	Additional configuration settings will need to be set
	in <TT>includes/config/user-ldap.php</TT>.
</OL>

<P>

Next, you may want to customize the event-specific fields found in
the <TT>includes/site_extras.php</TT> field.
If this is your first time using the calendar, you can skip
this step and come back later since this step
is <I>optional</I>.

<P>
You can use this feature to add extra
fields to your calendar events.  For example, you can add a URL or
a contact email address.  By default, the file is configured with
a single reminder field that allows the user to specify how long
before the event the reminder should be sent.  The
<TT>includes/site_extras.php</TT> file is well-documented, so look there for
examples and specific instructions on setting this up.
<P>
Keep in mind that if you want to use reminders, you will need to
setup the <TT>send_reminders.php</TT> script (see below) and keep your admin
setting for "Email enabled" set to "Yes" on the admin settings page.


<HR><H3><A NAME="reminders">Setting up email reminders</A></H3>
PHP does not come with a utility for executing time-based jobs.
So, in order to check periodically for email reminders, a shell
script was written in PHP.  You will need two things to get this working:
<OL>
<LI> You should have a version of PHP built as a CGI (so that you can run
  php from the command line).  This does not mean you must build all
  of PHP as a CGI.  You can still build PHP as a module for your web
  server and then build the CGI-based PHP later.
<LI> You must setup cron (on Linux/UNIX) or something like cron for Windows
to run the <TT>send_reminders.php</TT> script periodically.
</OL>

<P>
Building PHP as a CGI is outside the scope of these instructions.  But,
if you read the PHP instructions, you'll see that the default build
settings will build the CGI-based PHP.  If you really can't do this
(perhaps you don't have permission to install anything new on the
system), skip down a couple of paragraphs to an alternate solution
that does not require PHP CGI.
<P>

For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of
a user.  (This would be the same user that the web server
process runs as.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>1 * * * * cd /some/directory/webcalendar/tools; ./send_reminders.php</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Of course, replace the directory location to wherever the
<TT>send_reminders.php</TT> file can be found.  If you moved this out of the
tools directory (which is recommended for security reasons),
be sure to update <TT>send_reminders.php</TT> since it needs
to know where to find other WebCalendar files.
<P>

If you cannot setup PHP as a CGI or have no idea how, you can leave
<TT>send_reminders.php</TT> in its current location and access it via a URL.
IMHO, this is not the best choice, but it still works.  Setup a cron
job to access the URL.  For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to
the crontab entry of a user.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>1 * * * * wget http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php > /dev/null</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Of course, you should probably test this from the command line first to make
sure your setup is correct.  If you do not have <TT>wget</TT> installed on your
system, you can use any tool (lynx, perl script, etc.) that is capable
of making an HTTP request for this.


<HR><H3><A NAME="apachephp">Help with Apache/PHP/MySQL</A></H3>

If you're having problems getting Apache/PHP/MySQL setup (which
is the most common configuration for PHP), Linux/UNIX users can
try the following article from Linux Magazine written by
yours truly:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I><A HREF="http://www.linux-mag.com/online/php_01.html">The Scoop on PHP</A></I>, Linux Magaine
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

If you're a Windoze user, I highly recommend <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/foxserv">FoxServ</A>, which will install
and configure Apache, PHP and MySQL on a MS Windows machine.

	


<HR><H3><A NAME="palmpilot">Palm Pilot users</A></H3>
Exporting data to your Palm Pilot is possible with <TT>install-datebook</TT> tool,
which is part of the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158">pilot-link distribution</A>.
<P>
Unfortunately, there are some bugs in the install-datebook utility, so you'll
need to patch it before you compile and install pilot-link:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>patch -p0 < install-datebook.patch</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that <TT>install-datebook</TT> does not currently support repeating events, so
repeating events will not show up as repeating on your Palm Pilot.  The
tool is not smart enough to know when it's already added an event, so if
you use it twice with the same data, you'll get duplicates in your Palm
Pilot Calendar.


<HR><H3><A NAME="optional">Optional!</A></H3>
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not access
the "includes" directory.  See your web server documentation on how to do
this.
<P>
The <TT>includes</TT> directory has a <TT>index.html</TT> file that should
prevent users from obtaining a listing files.


<HR><H3><A NAME="runwithit">Run with it</A></H3>
Hey, you're done...  Give it a try by logging in using the default
"admin" account (if you're setup for multi-user) or just go to index.php
if you're setup for single-user mode.
<P>

The default setup for the web-based authentication includes
a single user login "demo" with the password set to "admin".


<HR><H3><A NAME="problems">Problems</A></H3>
