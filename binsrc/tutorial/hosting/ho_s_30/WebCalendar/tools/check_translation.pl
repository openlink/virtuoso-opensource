# This tool helps with the translation into other languages by verifying that
# all text specified in translate(), etranslate() and etooltip()
# within the application has a corresponding entry in the translation
# data file.  In short, this makes sure all text has a correspoding
# translation.
#
# Usage:
#	check_translation.pl languagefile
#	  ... or to check the most recently modified translation file
#	check_translation.pl
# Example:
#	check_translation.pl ../translations/English-US.txt
#
# Note: this utility should be run from this directory (tools).
