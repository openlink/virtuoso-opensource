The WebCalendar application is an <ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org/">Open-Source</ulink> implementation of
a multi-user web-calendar in PHP, released under the terms of the
<ulink
url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GPL</ulink>;
the project <ulink
url="http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/">homepage</ulink> is hosted
on <ulink url="http://sf.net/">SourceForge.net</ulink>. We include it
here as an example of how to take an existing PHP application designed
to run with Apache against mysql, postgresql or ODBC database
backends, and host it within Virtuoso.
</para>
<para>
The default username and password are admin/admin.
</para>
<para>The "Set the initial state" SQL files must be executed prior to running the demo.
The file create_local_dsn.sql will create a local DSN named "Local Virtuoso Tutorial HO-S-30", which will be used 
for connecting the database.
