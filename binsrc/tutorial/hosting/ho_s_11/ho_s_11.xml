  <para>The tutorial shows how C# classes are used to create User
  Defined Types (UDTs) in Virtuoso. </para>
  <para>Please follow the steps below to maximize the value of this tutorial:</para>

<orderedlist>
 <listitem>Click on the "Set Initial State" link which registers the 
 two C# classes within Virtuoso.  
 It also copies the restricted.dll and unrestricted.dll files to "tmp" directory in the server root. 
 Note that the directory must exists, must be writeable for the user running virtuoso and must be in the DirsAllowed parameter in Virtuoso ini file.
 Click on the "ho_s_11.sql" link to examine 
 the code behind this step.</listitem>
 <listitem>Click on the "Run" links to execute the demo.</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Demo Breakdown</para>

<orderedlist>
 <listitem>"ho_s_11.sql" performs the following steps
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>Registers the "Rest" and "UnRest" classes with Virtuoso. Click 
   on the "restricted.cs" and "unrestricted.cs" links to see the C# source code of these 
   classes.</listitem>
  </orderedlist></listitem>

 <listitem>The "unrestricted.vsp" is shows classes that try to access 
 File system and system variables. The "restricted.vsp", uses the same 
 clases, but cannot complete the execution sucessfully because the assembly 
 is imported with PERMISSION_SET = SAFE.  The sample shows the error returned upon 
 executing the classes.</listitem>
