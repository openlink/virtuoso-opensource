<title>Example</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>The SMTP client function can be used for automatic responses and notifications for DB events.</listitem>
  <listitem>The example shows mail delivery code for the hit notifications on the text triggers in DAV.</listitem>
  <listitem>When a free-text trigger query is defined to make an email notification, the trigger will have an email address stored in the column TTH_NOTIFY of the HITS table.</listitem>
  <listitem>The notification is a separate procedure that opens a cursor over the hits table. For every non-empty recipient, a message is sent.</listitem>
  <listitem>Note that in this example the mail server passed to the smtp_send() is null.
  This means that the default mail server from virtuoso.ini will be used for making the SMTP connection.</listitem>
