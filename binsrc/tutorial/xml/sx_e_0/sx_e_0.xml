<title>XMLELEMENT() function. Overview</title>

<para>XMLELEMENT takes an element name for identifier, an optional collection of attributes for the element, 
    and arguments that make up the element&apos;s content. 
    It returns an XML element. The second parameter may be omitted and at that time the 
    rest parameters may be present. If one of the arguments is a call of the <function>xpath_eval</function> returning 
    an attribute value, then this value would be added to element&apos;s content (not to element&apos;s attributes).

<title>XMLATTRIBUTES() function. Overview</title>
<para>
   This function creates a vector that may be used only as argument of 
   <function>XMLELEMENT</function> function. The vector has an even number of elements, each odd element is a name of an attribute, an
   even element is its value. If the attribute value is NULL, then no attribute and no value is created.
   If none of the attribute is created, then the function returns null.
   If a parameter of the function is a column name, then you can omit the &apos;AS clause&apos;, and Virtuoso uses the partially escaped form of 
   the column name as the attribute name.
