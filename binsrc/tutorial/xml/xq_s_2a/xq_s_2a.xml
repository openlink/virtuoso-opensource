    </para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>http://local.virt/DAV/PATHTO - local DAV collection. Contains all documents in DAV collection with path "PATHTO".
      </listitem>
      <listitem>http://..... - any other URI relates to remote DAV collections </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>In this example collection function is used to concatenate the entries from several RSS feed files and show their titles and link to the articles. example.vsp uses this collection to filter blogs by XPath exression.
