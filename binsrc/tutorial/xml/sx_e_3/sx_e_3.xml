<title>Example 3</title>
<para>This example shows a use of the XMLELEMENT() for creating the xml element &apos;Emp&apos; with three 
attributes - &apos;EmployeeID&apos;, &apos;firstname&apos; and &apos;lastname&apos; getting their values from the  
&apos;EmployeeID&apos;, &apos;FirstName&apos; and &apos;LastName&apos; columns, respectively. The pairs of attribute and its 
value are produced by XMLATTRIBUTES() function. If a parameter of the XMLATTRIBUTES() has no &apos;as clause&apos;, 
Virtuoso uses the partially escaped form of the column name as the attribute name. 
</para>
<programlisting>
select
     XMLELEMENT ("Emp", XMLATTRIBUTES ("EmployeeID", "FirstName" as "firstname", "LastName" as "lastname"))
from "Demo"."demo"."Employees";
