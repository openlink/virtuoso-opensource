      <para>
	  The demo retrieve a HTML pages containing attendees or bloggers listings and convert them to OPML.
	  The conversion is done with XQuery and user-defined XPath functions to resolve the feeds URLs. 
      </para>
      <para>
	  The demo also retrieve few OPML files and re-construct them having the feeds URLs if they are missing.
      </para>
      <para>
	  When setting the initial state, the demo starts to retrieve pages from the different sites. 
	  It could take a long time depending on the Internet connection of the machine that Virtuoso is running on. 
	  It is safe to leave the pop-up open without waiting it to finish and press on the "Run" links,
	  however if this is the first time you run the initial state, the demo will show only partial results.
	  Once the feeds are resolved they will be cached locally in a database table and the generated OPML files will
	  be stored as a WebDAV resources.
