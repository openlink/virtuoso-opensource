<title>Example</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>This example displays user data using XSLT to customize the look.</listitem>
  <listitem>The result is the same as in <ulink url="../vs_x_2/vs_x_2.vsp">VS-X-2</ulink>, but XSL-T transformation is done in the VSP.</listitem>
  <listitem><para>The http_xslt() can be replaced (for main functionality) by the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>xml_tree_doc() over an XML document</listitem>
      <listitem>xslt() with XSL-T stylesheet URI and result from xml_tree_doc()</listitem>
      <listitem>http_value() with result from xslt()</listitem>
    </itemizedlist></listitem>
  <listitem>The above describes the steps that the web server makes in the VSP execution when http_xslt() is called.
   This is not a direct equivalent, because Content-Type is not manipulated, as it is with http_xslt().
   This means that web server can setup a Content-Type if it's not specified, otherwise it is specified in xsl:output element.</listitem>
   <listitem>The same is true for encoding. If it is necessary to manipulate content-type with xsl:output, then use xml_tree_doc_media_type() to retrieve the media type from the XML entity, produced from xml-tree_doc(), and manually set 'Content-Type' header with http_header().
   The above steps are useful for VSP&amp;XSLT understanding, but in practice the http_xslt() is more suitable.
   The http_xslt() is most appropriate if all content that produces a VSP should be transformed.</listitem>

   <listitem>In the case where a piece of XML data is to be inserted in the middle of the HTML part of VSP, it cannot be done with http_xslt(). It may only be done with the step-by-step way above.</listitem>
