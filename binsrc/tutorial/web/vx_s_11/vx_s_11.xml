    <para>
	The VSPX (Virtuoso Server Pages Extensions) framework allows 
	form controls to be rendered as XForms 1.0 components. 
	This approach take an advantage to check input field's data-type 
	and to restrict value using XML-Schema constraints. Thus 
        it's possible to make user agent performs input validation 
        before sending a data back to server.	
	It's IMPORTANT that this approach is only possible with browsers
	that have a plug-in or natively supports XForms 1.0.

    As can be seen the XForms rendering do not require any changes to existing VSPX pages (except logic to turn it on).
