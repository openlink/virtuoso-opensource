<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>A resource has a group and an owner user, just like files in a Unix file system.</listitem>
  <listitem>A resource has flags determining the read, write, and execute privileges of it's owner,
  other members of the owner's group, and all other users on it.</listitem>
  <listitem>Additionally it has a free text indexing flag.</listitem>
  <listitem>Collections are resources also. These have the same flags but the free text index
  flag is treated differently.</listitem>
  <listitem><para>DAV server asks for authentication in the following situations:</para>
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>on the read operation if URL is not public readable</listitem>
      <listitem>on the write operations if URL is not public writable</listitem>
	</itemizedlist></listitem>
  <listitem>The read operations are GET, POST, PROPFIND, HEAD</listitem>
  <listitem>The write operations are LOCK, PUT, MOVE, COPY, DELETE, PROPPATCH</listitem>
  <listitem>The Webdav admin account has full access rights to the Webdav repository, regardless of privilege flags.</listitem>
  <listitem>The server will try to match the user to resource owner, second match to the group ownership,
  and last to the additional groups membership.</listitem>
  <listitem>If the URL is public readable, the request will be processed without asking for authentication.</listitem>
  <listitem>The special flag in permissions can be set to the no-index, index, index recursively.</listitem>
  <listitem>On resources, the last two settings act in the same way: if the resource is a text document,
  the content will be free text indexed, otherwise not.</listitem>
  <listitem>On collections, the 'no-index' will stop indexing of all direct and indirect members.</listitem>
  <listitem>The 'index this' flag will cause indexing only over direct members (resources).</listitem>
  <listitem>The 'index recursively' will allow free-text indexing of all direct and indirect members.</listitem>
  <listitem>The values indicated in the WebDAV content management UI are N, T and R for the no-index, index, index recursively respectively.</listitem>
