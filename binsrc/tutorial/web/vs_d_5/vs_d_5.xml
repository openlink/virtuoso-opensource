<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>The WebDAV content is free-text indexed on all documents with a text content.</listitem>
  <listitem>The documents may have their indexing disabled by turning off the indexing flag. (see DAV security)</listitem>
  <listitem>By default the WebDAV content is in real time mode. That means after insert/update/delete
  the content immediately will be indexed.</listitem>
  <listitem>The real time mode will update the free text index as soon as the indexed resources change.
  Advantage is that a text search query can be performed immediately after an action.
  This will however take substantially longer if any significant number
  of resources are regularly updated.</listitem>

<title>Batch Mode indexing</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>In this mode, changes of the WebDAV content are logged for later indexing.</listitem>
  <listitem>The index is updated periodically, at approximately the specified period (in minutes),
  if allowed by other background tasks.</listitem>
  <listitem>The index refresh period is a scheduled event period to refresh the free-text index in batch mode.</listitem>
  <listitem>To switch between modes in the Conductor UI, go to the "Web Application Server" tab, then go to the "Content Management" tab and then go to the "Text Triggers" sub-tab.</listitem>
  <listitem><para>This can also be achieved using a sql command. For example to turn batch mode on for 7 minute updates use:</para>
<programlisting>
  SQL&gt; DB.DBA.vt_batch_update ('WS.WS.SYS_DAV_RES', 'ON', 7);
