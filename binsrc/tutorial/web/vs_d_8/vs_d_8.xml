<title>Example of making XML reports in DAV</title>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
  <listitem>The example makes XML reports on the Demo database and inserts them into a user's DAV folder.</listitem>
  <listitem>The application will take a user registration, and make a DAV account</listitem>
  <listitem>Enter parameters for a query, e.g. product group for tracking sales</listitem>
  <listitem>A resulting XML report is put in the user's created DAV collection.</listitem>
  <listitem>Once the report is made a HTTP redirect occurs to the new resource.</listitem>
  <listitem>Note that the login for DAV will be different from the application's login. This is OK in this context.</listitem>
