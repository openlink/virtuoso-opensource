<listitem>When processing some form data in VSPs, there may be errors in the PL code (for example due to deadlock condition).</listitem>
<listitem><para>The most popular way of catching the SQL errors is to declare an exception handler.</para>
<programlisting>declare error varchar;

<listitem>To simplify VSP production, the error handler can be written in a common file and included in each page.</listitem>

<refsect1 id="VS-B-6b">
<title>Deadlock Example</title>
<para>The first example demonstrates the creation of a universal deadlock handler.
If this file is included in any VSP the deadlock condition will cause a retry up to 3 times on an
operation that follows the handler. The VSP simulates the deadlock situation by signalling the error.
The error handler is therefore called.</para>

<refsect1 id="VS-B-6c">
<title>Calculator with error handler</title>
<para>The second example is the vs_b_3 Calculator example. In this example there is an added handler to trap
errors such as division by zero, and entering characters instead of numbers.</para>
