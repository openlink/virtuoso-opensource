    <title>Preliminaries</title>
    <para>Usually data-bound controls as data-list, data-set etc. are 
	using a relational data (from tables, local or remote). But in some cases data
	is available as XML, which is most convenient to use as such instead of 
	filling and using an intermediate table as data source. 
	For this cases VSPX components (which allows data-binding) supports special 
	set of attributes (see documentation for details). With these attributes 
  it is possible to bind XML data to the control's value, row-set etc.

    <para>The following approaches are demonstrated:</para> 
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
    <listitem>Binding a XML data to VSPX components, instead of using relational data</listitem>
    <listitem>Using XML manipulation routines to insert update or delete 
    XML data.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
    In details example itself shows:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Filling a select list from XML document</listitem>
    <listitem>Filling a repeatable control (data-set) with XML data.</listitem>
    <listitem>Custom ordering functionality in repeatable control, using XML manipulation routines.</listitem>
