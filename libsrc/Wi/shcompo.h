/* \file
'shcompo' stands for [SH]areable [Comp]iled [O]bject -- a thing that is compiled once and used many times.
The thing is identified by a key such as a vector of SQL query text, uid and gid.
Things are kept in a global cache.

When a thread tries to use a thing, it should lock it first and release after the use.
To compile a thing, the thread places it into cache then compiles then updates the cache.
When a thing is being compiled by other thread, a mutex gives a possibility to wait for the end of compilation.

Each shcompo has a reference counter. It's increased every time the shcompo is
locked for use in external procedures and every time it's registered in the cache.
It's decreased every time the shcompo is unlocked and every time it's removed from cache due to stale or
cache optimization. When reference count is zero, shcompo is being destroyed.
The shcompo may be declared staled and removed from global hashtable or caches
to prevent its use in future processing,
but it can remain in memory for a while if it's in use.
It can become stale without being explicitly declares as such (say, qr_needs_recompile can be set),
so a method should be used to check whether the shcompo is stale, not just an access to the field.
