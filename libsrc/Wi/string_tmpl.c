/*

   The function cmp_like wants two arguments, a string and a pattern.
   It's supposed that the string comes from a string-column of database
   or any such source of data from which we try to find something (e.g.
   it could be the line from the text file, or some field in the RAM-based
   object in Lisp). The pattern respectively is supposed to be supplied
   by the user, for example from some search form, which is then converted
   to SQL-where clause containing LIKE-expression, where the left side is
   of course the column name (of type varchar, i.e. string), and the
   right side is the pattern searched for.

   If the pattern does not begin with an at-sign (@) or with two
   asterisks (**), then the we test the equality of the string and pattern
   with the ordinary wildcard matching function wc_match, which behaves
   approximately like the filename pattern matching in the Unix shell.
   (But not like the regular expression matching in utilities like grep
   and sed).

   The following characters have special significance in the pattern:

   ?    Matches any single character.

   *    Matches zero or more of any characters.

   [ ]  (Called a group-expression here)
   Matches any one of the enclosed characters, unless the
   first character following the opening [ is ^, then matches
   only if the character (in the datum string) is not any one of
   those specified after the ^. (I.e. the ^ negates the meaning
   of this expression.)
   You can use character ranges like 0-9 (shorthand for 0123456789)
   inside the brackets, in which case the character in the datum
   string must be lexically within the inclusive range of of that
   pair (of course the character at the left side of hyphen must
   be lexically (that is, its ascii value) less than the
   character at the right side).

   The hyphen can be included in the character set by putting it
   as the first or last character. The right bracket (]) can
   be included by putting it as the first character in the expression,
   i.e. immediately after the opening bracket ([) or the caret (^)
   following it.

   Examples:
   [abc]          Matches any of the letters a, b and c.
   [^0123456789]  Matches anything, except digits. (same as [^0-9])
   [[]            Matches [
   []]            Matches ]
   [][]           Matches ] and [
   [^]]           Matches anything except ]
   [A-Za-z0-9]    Matches all the alphanumeric characters.
   [-*+/]         Matches the four basic arithmetic operators.
   [-]            Matches to single hyphen.
   []-]           Matches to ] or -
   [-[] or [[-]   Matches to - or [

   That is, the hyphen indicates a range between characters, unless
   it's the first or the last character in the group expression,
   in which case it matches just to itself.

   @   Matches the character last matched to ? or group-expression.
   For example ?*@ matches to all strings which begin with the same
   character they end. However, if there is neither ? nor [] expression
   at the left side of @ in the pattern, then @ matches just to
   itself. (E.g. *@* should match to all E-mail addresses).


   Any other characters match ONLY to themselves, that is, not even to
   the upper- or lowercase variants of the same letter. Use expression
   like [Wo][Oo][Rr][Dd] if you want to find any mixed-case variant of
   the word "word", or use the substring search explained below.


   However, if the pattern begins with an at-sign (@) then we compare
   the rest of pattern to string with the fuzzy matching function
   strfmatchp, allowing differences of few characters in quality and
   quantity (length). If there's more than one @ in the beginning of
   pattern given to cmp_like. they are all skipped, and so many
   additional liberties are given for the match function.  The more
   @-signs there are in the beginning, the more fuzzy (liberal) is the
   search. For example: pattern "@Johnson" will match to string
   "Jonsson" and pattern "@@Johnson" will match also to "Jansson".

   If the pattern begins with two asterisks, then we do diacritic- and
   case insensitive substring search (with the function nc_strstr),
   trying to find the string given in the rest of pattern from the
   datum string.

   E.g. "**escort" will match to "Ford Escort vm. 1975".


   If there are any ISO8859.1 diacritic letters (e.g. vowels with
   accents or umlaut-signs, or letters like the spanish n with ~ (tilde))
   present in the datum string, then the plain unaccented (7-bit ASCII)
   variant of the same letter in the pattern string will match to it.
   But if there are any diacritic letter specified in the pattern string,
   then it will match only to the upper- or lowercase variant of exactly
   the same diacritic letter.
   The rationale behind this is that the people entering the information
   to database can use the exact spelling for the word, for example
   writing the word "Citroen" with the umlaut-e (e with two dots above it),
   as it is actually written in French, and the people who search for
   the Citroens can still find it without need to remember the exact
   orthography of the French, by just giving a word "citroen".
   And this allows also the people who have just plain 7-bit ascii
   keyboards to search for the words like Ra"a"kkyla" (place in Finland,
   a" means umlaut-a, i.e. a with two dots above it), just by entering
   the word raakkyla.

   So the following holds with the substring searches:

   1) Any non-alphabetic character in the pattern matches just to itself
   in the datum string (e.g. ? to ? and 3 to 3).

   2) Any 7-bit ascii letter (A-Z and a-z without any diacritic signs)
   in the pattern matches to any diacritic variant of the same letter
   (as well as to same 7-bit ascii letter) in the datum string, either
   in the upper- or lowercase.

   3) Any diacritic letter (8-bit ISO8859.1 letter) in the pattern matches
   only to the same letter (in the upper- or lowercase) in the datum
   string.


   Note that because the functions strfmatchp and nc_strstr use macros
   which consider also the characters like:
   @, [, \, ], and ^ to be letters, they will match against characters
   `, {, |, }, and ~ respectively, which is just all right, because
   in some older implementations of European character sets those
   characters mark the uppercase and lowercase variants of certain
   diacritic letters. And I think it's generally better to match
   too liberally and so maybe sometimes give something entirely off
   the wall to the user, than to miss something important because of
   too strict criteria.

   Of course, when searching from the data which contains text in
   some wide-character format (like certain coding systems for
   Japanese and Chinese where one character is coded with two bytes)
   neither fuzzy matching function nor nc_strstr function presented here
   should be used, as they would often match on entirely spurious cases.
