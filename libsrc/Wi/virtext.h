   SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY_PERMANENTLY
   When Connect Option SQL_ACCESS_MODE has been once set to
   this one, it cannot be anymore switched back to
   either SQL_MODE_READ_WRITE (0UL) or SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY (1UL).
   This can be used to implement for example surely
   read-only Web-sample-forms, which cannot be tweaked
   back to read-write mode by any means, or also to implement
   the read-only button of the setup-dialog of KUBL ODBC-driver
   (WIODBC.DLL) so that if checked, then all the connections done
   to that datasource will always be in this mode from the very
   beginning.

   SQL_INDEX_OBJECT_ID is an extension to the set of defines

   SQL_INDEX_CLUSTERED (1),
   SQL_INDEX_HASHED (2)
   SQL_INDEX_OTHER (3)
   returned by SQLStatistics (module sqlext.c) in its
   seventh, TYPE column.

   In the case where index is also OBJECT_ID index, the value
   of this (= 8) is added (or bit-ored if you think it that way)
   to the value that would be otherwise returned,
   e.g. it will be 8+1 = 9 for CLUSTERED OBJECT_ID indices,
   and 8+3= 11 for other kind of OBJECT_ID indices.
