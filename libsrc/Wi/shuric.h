/* \file
'shuric' stands for [SH]areable [URI] [C]ontent -- data that are retrieved
from some URIs, that are cached in memory, that refers each other.

Shuric may have non-NULL URI. There may not be two shurics with same non-NULL URI.
This URI is a key in the global hashtable of shared resources so it's easy
to retrieve shuric by its URI.

Shurics may have NULL URI, indicating that they are anonymous objects not cached
in the global hashtable of shared resources.

Anonymous shuric may be stored in some cache, solely for speed optimization.
it can be found in a cache by some key (that is a tree of boxes)
but there's no warranty that two retrievals from a cache by same key will return same result.
(e.g., cache can be of limited size and can wipe out least popular items).
It is an error to cache a shuric that has non-NULL URI.
It is an error to try to put a shuric in two different caches.

Shurics are of different types. Every type of shurics has its own table
of member functions. There may not be two shurics with same non-NULL URI and
different types.

Shurics can depend on other shuric. E.g., a shuric for XSLT stylesheet A
can 'include' a shuric for XSLT stylesheet B if A contains xsl:include directive for B.

Each shuric has a reference counter. It's increased every time the shuric is
locked for use in external procedures, every time it's imported/included
into another shuric and every time it's registered in the cache.
It's decreased every time the shuric is unlocked, every time somebody
destroys an 'importer' and every time it's removed from cache due to stale or
cache optimization. When reference count is zero, shuric is being destroyed.
The destroying of the shuric decreases reference counters of shurics that are
imported from or inserted into it, so they may, in turn, be destroyed.
The shuric may be declared staled and removed from global hashtable or caches
to prevent its use in future processing,
but it can remain in memory for a while if it's in use and/or is referenced by temporary shurics.

When the shuric stales, all shurics that includes it will stale too.
But if A imports B, not includes B, status of B is not affecting status of A;
that's the only difference between 'include' and 'import'.
