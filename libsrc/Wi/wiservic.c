/*
   New module by Antti Karttunen 29. May 1997
   for installing and starting the Kubl Server executable as
   Windows NT service. With extensive modifications
   to main function in chil.c
   Accompanied with WISERVIC.H, containing prototypes
   and few common macros required here and in chil.c
   Contains also code (e.g. an auxiliary function like
   wisvc_handle_W_option) for Unix builds, so do not miss
   this module from them.

   4.Jun.1997 AK  Added call to main_the_rest() (in chil.c) to the end
   of wisvc_KublServiceStart
   Added the function (dummy macro in Unix platforms)
   wisvc_send_service_running_status() which can be
   called in the initialization when you think is an
   appropriate time to signal the service starter
   that "the Kubl Server has successfully started".
   At least it is called in wisvc_KublServiceStart
   after all the initializations and roll forwards.
   (If called multiple times then the latter invocations
   of it and wisvc_send_wait_hint are silently ignored.)

/*

   A service configuration program uses the CreateService function to
   install a service in a service control manager database.
   The application-defined schSCManager handle must have
   SC_MANAGER_CREATE_SERVICE access to the SCManager object.
   The following example shows how to install a service.

   Start type is one of the following:
   SERVICE_AUTO_START   Specifies a device driver or Win32 service started
   by the service control manager automatically during
   system startup.
   SERVICE_DEMAND_START Specifies a device driver or Win32 service started
   by the service control manager when a process calls
   the StartService function.
   SERVICE_DISABLED     Specifies a device driver or Win32 service that can
   no longer be started.

   Error control type is one of the following:

   SERVICE_ERROR_IGNORE   The startup (boot) program logs the error but
   continues the startup operation.
   SERVICE_ERROR_NORMAL   The startup program logs the error and displays
   a message but continues the startup operation.
   SERVICE_ERROR_SEVERE   The startup program logs the error. If the
   last-known-good configuration is being started,
   the startup operation continues. Otherwise,
   the system is restarted with the last-known-good
   configuration.
   SERVICE_ERROR_CRITICAL The startup program logs the error, if possible.
   If the last-known-good configuration is being
   started, the startup operation fails. Otherwise,
   the system is restarted with the last-known-good
   configuration.

/*
   To start a service, the following function uses a handle created
   with CreateService given from the function CreateKublService above,

   used to start either a Win32 service or a driver service, but this
   function assumes that a Win32 service is being started. After
   starting the service, the function uses the members of the
   SERVICE_STATUS structure returned by the QueryServiceStatus
   function to track the progress of the Win32 service.

   When calling from function above (wisvc_CreateKublService)

   to the service being started, so that it will use the arguments
   specified permanently in BinaryPathName, so that service's
   startup will be identical each time, also when it is started
   automatically in the next boot-up. This is because arguments given
   in StartService are already lost at that time, but ones specified
   in BinaryPathName will remain, being available in original argv
   of main function (and stored immediately into wisvc_Main_G_argv).
   It would work also with discard_argv being zero, but this way we
   may spot few insipid bugs faster, because arguments specified by

   running (with the next function wisvc_send_service_running_status),
