 *  Performs a keyword compare
 *  This functions tests if the second string (which is usually longer than
 *  the first) begins with the keyword in the first string.
 *  If so, it returns a pointer to the first non-white character in the second
 *  string; otherwise a NULL is returned.
 *
 *  Example
 *	keyword		source			returns
 *      -----------------------------------------------
 *	"SELECT"	"SELECT\tA,..."		"A,..."
 *	"SELECT"	"SELECTALL ..."		NULL
 *	"SELECTALL"	"SELECT "		NULL
 *	"SELECT"	"SELECT"		""
