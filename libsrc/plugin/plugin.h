\brief System-independent interface between dock (executable) and plugin (DLL)

There are many OS-specific APIs for loading DLLs to an executable. Similarly,
version info structures are vary from OS to OS. To write plugin/dock logic
easily, small system-independent interface is specified.

To attach a plugin, dock locates DLL file and loads it into memory. Then it
calls plugin check function, and passes dock's version info and some
application-specific data about dock's internal state. If check function
"agrees" that its plugin may be connected to given dock, it returns
plugin's version info with no error diagnostics inside, otherwise it returns
info with an error. Dock may call plugin check function more than
once, e.g. with different instances of dock's version info.

If plugin returns no errors, it may be connected to dock. At this time, plugin may
do some long initializations, sanity checks etc. If it still reports no
errors, it may be activated. For time-critical applications, it's good idea
to connect all pugins before starting time-critical operations, then
activate all of them.

Similarly, plugin may be deactivated and disconnected later.

Plugin's (dis-)connection and (de-)activation functions may be called more
than once, and in any order. There's only one rule: while function is listed
in plugin's unit_version_s structure, it may be called. To avoid calling of
the function, set the appropriate field of structure to NULL. */
